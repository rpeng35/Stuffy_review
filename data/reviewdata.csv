Nessie Walker,10/10/2024,"my dog recently passed away and i was able to save up enough money to get a cuddle clone and when it came in, me and my family started bawling. excellent attention to detail, captured his visage and markings perfectly down to the coat layering and fur length. they also added the small pink spot that was on his nose which i forgot to add, so massive compliments to the designers that take such good note of even the little things. recommending to everyone i know if they ever wanted a stuffie of their pets",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Amy,10/09/2024,"I received my cuddle clone of my poodle bichon dog that passed away very suddenly. He was my baby and was so missed, I jumped at the chance to have a snuggle buddy to hold in those hard moments of missing him. The team did a great job of matching his face, the look, his typical body stance. The color was a little more blond than apricot as I had specified, but close. I wish they did a final approval of their design. I am 99% happy with the outcome and appreciate all they do for us pet parents after a loss.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Angela,10/06/2024,I received a clone as a tribute to my rainbow dog Barney. The clone is something that I always wanted to have and am so thankful to have now. The detail of Barney having one half blue brown eye is amazing to me. Barney will live on forever in my memories and I am so grateful to have this plush to hug when I miss him. It is so well crafted and makes me very happy. Thank you to the artists who created my fur Barney.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Angela,10/06/2024,"I am so thankful that I was able to get a cuddle clone of my fur baby Chaos. Chaos is a puppy but I always want to have him nearby when we can't be close. This is something that I can take with me when we have to be apart. I am blown away at how close it resembles him. The clone looks exactly like Chaos. Honestly, it is scary to me just how perfect it looks like him. Thank you to the artists who created my clone, it will forever be cherished.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chelsea Bray,09/22/2024,"Honestly, I cannot recommend a cuddle clone enough. My mother’s dog passed away suddenly in the middle of the night and she was finding it so difficult to cope with her absence. I bought her the clone as a gift and she raves about it. Not only does it look just like the dog, but it’s given my mom something to hug and hold when the grieve is too heavy and she was able to put some of her ashes in the little tummy pocket. Nothing can take away the grief of losing a pet, but this has helped give some comfort during this tough time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I included lots of pictures of our girl and cuddle clones even made her ears exactly the same and even her patches of mixed colours.. highly recommend!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Carmen,09/22/2024,"My brother, sister-in-law and their three kids recently lost Aspen. He was 11 years old and the sweetest boy. I didn’t know how to console them during their loss, so I sent them a Cuddle Clone. My sister-in-law had me in tears as she recorded herself opening the gift. It was a surprise, but the grieving was raw and real. I’d share the video, but it’s private. I just hadn’t seen how the clone looked and wanted to get a sense of the memory. He turned out perfect - little spots of brown fur and all! Thank you for this treasure and for capturing all his features.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Annie,09/17/2024,"My sister was heart broken because her best friend has crossed the Rainbow Bridge. Although nothing can compare to her best companion, but having a clone to hold on as a remembrance can help with the grieving procecess. I really want to thank the cuddle clone team and Jerome for their consistent asisstance and responses to my emails.Their assurances and help really helped me perfected the cuddle clone for my sister.

Marilyn Adams,09/16/2024," People grieve differently and the hardest part about losing my best friend, faithful companion and most wonderful dog ever was just how I lost her. After 17 years, nearly 2 decades, an accident took her from me and left me holding nothing but her tags. For years I had avoided doing any 'end of life' things with my doggy daughter. It hurt too much and she was still in good health, so when people would send me ideas like paw prints, hair lockets, etc, I would file it away in a list of things I wanted before I said goodbye. However, I didn't get anything from that list. There was nothing left of her. No paws, no fur, nothing and I went from feeling like I had the world on a platter to feeling like I had lost everything I loved with no proof it was even there to begin with, other than some left behind sweaters and toys. I was dead inside for so long and still feel that way most days. So when my friends asked what I wanted most, I said a Cuddle Clone. I needed something physical of \her\"" to touch",to still have,to cling to,I guess. I wanted to just see her again in more 3D than a crystal memory block,"which was the closest I had to \""her.\"" First off: The process. I uploaded about 10 to 15 photos of Pookie and filled out a general questionnaire. I was asked about 10 questions",all about her and what she was like,what my favorite features were,etc. They kept in touch via email multiple times with follow up questions to help them better know what she was like. I received about 4 of those asking for more detail. They come with customizable options like an added keepsake pocket but I felt weird putting that on her but wish I had now as it would hold her tags. I still love it. Review: It was striking pulling the stuffie out of the box. From the first glimpse,I knew it would be rough because I could already see they had gotten her chest hair pattern perfect. I sobbed and inspected the clone,suddenly remembering the questionnaire and found they had gotten my two favorite features perfect,along with many other things I had forgotten I loved about her. Pookies Whispers. I called them whispers because when she was in my arms,I would have to brush her little hairs out of her ears before I could sing to her because they would tickle her ears. Her feet as well,were my second favorite and they got those perfect. Pookies left paw was Polka Dotted while her right looked like it had been dipped in white. They got them spot on,literally,along with her tail fan which must have been hard to do. I can't get over how much the clone looks like her and it helps having something to hold again. It's brought up mixed feelings in me and in those that have known about it. Some say they love the idea while others think it's just a set back on getting over her passing. I don't know which is true but I do know it helps to have,in an odd,small way,my best friend back. You guys are the best,"ever.""",,,,,,,,,,
Tammy Blackstone,09/16/2024,"I tragically lost Raina at only 2½ years old, on july 28th. I couldn't get over her and cried wverytime I thought of her. I made the choice to order a cuddle clone, and I'm so happy I did! She is obviously not life sized, but I can see her in it. I have her in my bedroom and I'll place her on my bed. She startles me at times because I'll come around a corner and see a \dog\"" sitting on the bed. I know I will treasure this clone and it gave me the chance to hold \""Raina\"" and tell her how sorry I was for what happened to her.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I was missing her so badly and thought this might help with my healing. I cried when I I opened the box and the artists did such a good job that my parents could tell it was Cutie (I had not told them I had ordered this). I have it on my bed in her spot and the grief doesn’t hurt as much, because it’s like a part of her is still with me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mike Pittenger,09/04/2024,Omg Looks just like her...my sweet girl. She passed away back in March 2024 due to a tumor next to her heart.

Michael Arnold sr.,09/02/2024,"I was never a cat person but this little kitten stole my heart . She died after 6 short years. I was really heartbroken 💔. Just couldn't get her out of my mind. I Went into depression. My daughter Jessica texted me one day asking for pictures of Kallie she took those pictures contacted Cuddle Clones sent those pictures. Jessica knows how much Kallie ment to me and ordered this cuddle clone of Kallie. September 1st, 2024 she brought Kallie the Cuddle Clone to me. I sat there in shock. I couldn't believe the accuracy on the Cuddle Clone of my beloved Kallie. I started to tear up my emotions overwhelmed I started crying. I'm telling everyone if you miss your fur baby contact Cuddle Clones. You won't be disappointed. I want to thank Cuddle Clones and my daughter Jessica Erkenbrecker. Forever Grateful too both of you. It makes it a little easier having Kallie my Cuddle Clone around me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We can't give it to her until October (her birthday) but I will be sure to post another review for that! Our mom is in a wheelchair due to a stroke, and sassy was her only companion. When she had to have sass put down, at the age of 15, it broke her. She has been wanting to get another dog, but she is not physically capable of doing it. Hopefully \sassy\"" fills her heart with what she needs ❤️""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Laura Ramirez,08/27/2024,"We lost our dog in July, and bought a cuddle clone to help us with our grieving process. They followed up with us during the process to make sure they had enough angles/pictures. She looks great. Obviously her colorings isn’t exact, but it’s closer than I expected it to be. Our only complaint is the her muzzle is a big bigger than hers was, but I’m still blown away. When I see her from behind sitting on our bed I have to take a second glance because I swear it’s her. The order came sooner than expected and we are extremely pleased with the craftsmanship and time they took to make her. I would highly recommend Cuddle Clones to anyone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

S.S.,08/26/2024,We absolutely 💯 ❤️ love our cuddle clones pet! My daughter and I run a wildlife rescue and we have surrogate wildlife ambassadors that help us teach the public about wildlife. Chass was a barred owl that my daughter glove trained to show the public the barred personality and talk about there role in the ecosystem. During the 4th of July weekend neighbors that lived next to our sanctuary lite off fireworks causing chass to have heart attack. While owls are tough they are also fragile as well. My daughter had a heart attack 3 months prior to chass passing away. She was very sad and missed her companion so for.her birthday I sent in chass pictures.

Taylor,08/23/2024,"We ordered a Cuddle Clone of our sweet dog, Rebel, who recently passed. The ordering process was simple, and the level of detail was great.

Brian Johnson,08/22/2024,"Please bear in mind that any comments that aren't stellar are just FYI for future purchases and I will be making another purchase down the road as I have another senior dog that has medical issues. My dog Gumbo was a rescue and part of our family for 15 years. He took an unexpected health turn and his loss was hard. Ordering from a mobile device with limited time is not recommended. I had to restart my process several times and that 6 not ideal. That also resulted in a typo of my dog's name and being I was busy I failed to check it and so the tag shows an incorrect name and I wasn't sure how to fix that. A minor issue and my mistake. The company was very responsive with additional photo needs and I felt the end result was shipped faster than expected. The end result? We all cried a lot. There are certain details that were captured that are so accurate it's close to heartbreaking because I miss him so much and it's a comfort that we can, in a way, still have him around. I would recommend Cuddle Clones to anyone who has a four legged family member.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Natalie Lasalle,08/22/2024,We lost our boy unexpectedly at 3 years old when he went status epilepticus. It was a shock. This is the second time I've order from Cuddle Clone.

This is the first plush I've order and they did such a good job my cat thought it was real and started grooming it. Having something to hug when I miss my puppy really helps. Thank you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tina Schaefer,08/22/2024,Thank you so much for bringing my best friend back to me. The artist who created her did an amazing job!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
R.J.,08/22/2024,This was the most amazing gift I could have ever given to my boyfriend. He had her for 12 and a half years and I was privileged to know her for the last 8 months of her life. She’s PERFECT!! Thank you so much for making him smile!!!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Brian Johnson,08/22/2024,"Please bear in mind that any comments that aren't stellar are just FYI for future purchases and I will be making another purchase down the road as I have another senior dog that has medical issues. My dog Gumbo was a rescue and part of our family for 15 years. He took an unexpected health turn and his loss was hard. Ordering from a mobile device with limited time is not recommended. I had to restart my process several times and that 6 not ideal. That also resulted in a typo of my dog's name and being I was busy I failed to check it and so the tag shows an incorrect name and I wasn't sure how to fix that. A minor issue and my mistake. The company was very responsive with additional photo needs and I felt the end result was shipped faster than expected. The end result? We all cried a lot. There are certain details that were captured that are so accurate it's close to heartbreaking because I miss him so much and it's a comfort that we can, in a way, still have him around. I would recommend Cuddle Clones to anyone who has a four legged family member.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Taylor,08/22/2024,"We ordered a Cuddle Clone of our sweet dog, Rebel, who recently passed. The ordering process was simple, and the level of detail was great. They nailed the coloring and pattern of our girl, and captured the details most important to us. We would absolutely recommend purchasing a Cuddle Clone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Terri Macurak,08/16/2024,"Cuddle Clones did an excellent job recreating my daughter's cat, Mr. Jinx. My daughter was inconsolable when Mr. Jinx crossed the Rainbow Bridge. I commissioned a Cuddle Clone. Cuddle Clones communicated effectively to ensure they got every last detail right, down to his beauty mark. Everything was spot on. I received my Mr. Jinx today. The smile on my daughter's face when she saw her boy was worth it. Thank you, Cuddle Clones!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
J.W.,08/14/2024,"I lost my Joey at the end of 2023. He came to me as a special needs adoption, and was the light of my world while I had him. Joey had a particular look- no eyes, and as he had lost all of his teeth, his tongue always stuck out. I ordered a Cuddle Clone, happy just to have a stuffed animal that might look a little like my guy. I was overjoyed at the detail and accuracy- I don’t think the photos do it justice. I just ordered a cuddle clone for my sister after the loss of her dog, and am so looking forward to her receiving him. Absolutely money well spent- I have a little bit of Joey in my life still.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Karlah Chavolla,08/09/2024,I purchased a clone of my cat son who passed away suddenly. It's been very hard adjusting to life without him so I ordered it to make it easier for myself. I was super nervous but when I received it I cried. They did such an amazing job and honestly exceeded my expectations. He looks just like my baby and I'm so happy to have a piece of him to hold at night. It gives me so much comfort to see him because he looks identical. When I had questions about my order Manuela was super helpful and very quick with her responses. I would definitely order from here again. Thank you for giving me my baby back.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
J.S.,08/09/2024,"I ordered this clone of my daughter’s cat Gracie, as a HS graduation gift for June ‘24. She loves her cat so much & is already talking about how much she is going to miss her next year when she’s away at college. I decided to take advantage of the offers & order it early. My plan was to hold on to it until June graduation, but when it arrived, I was blown away at the detail & craftsmanship. I was so nervous it was not going to be what I expected, and was trying to keep my expectations low. But my gosh, it’s so perfect, I almost cried. I’ve decided to give her “Gracie” clone to her for Christmas, because I simply can’t wait until spring. If it was up to my husband, he would’ve handed it to her the day it arrived, lol. I’ve shared my pics with all my co-workers & I’m guessing they’ll be ordering their own pet clones soon. To the artist that created our plush, THANK YOU for the priceless keepsake. I promise you’ve made one young lady, so very happy, and one momma grateful for the piece of home that she can take with her to college.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Craig,08/09/2024,"I lost my cat Max two years ago, after 14.5 years with him. He grew up with my children and we were heartbroken to have to let him go peacefully. My husband purchased this as a Christmas present and I opened it tonight. It’s like having a piece of him back with me. Thank you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pattie Hinkley,08/09/2024,"Many years ago I purchased a Cuddle Clone for my daughter after she lost her cat and it was just so beautiful. So when my Happy went to Rainbow Bridge I decided to purchase a Cuddle Clone of him to help me with my grief. I want to say thank you so very much to the amazing artists who recreated my precious Happy in such amazing detail. From his big front paws, to his curled tail the details were on point. They worked with me throughout the process to make sure everything was perfect. Even his soul mate Harley Quinn liked his clone, and I was very happy about that. I have him currently sitting in his favorite cat house and everyday I say hi and give him a pat on the head it has been wonderful. I know I won't ever have him back but I'm thankful to the Cuddle Clones company that I have something that I can hold and enjoy remembering all the memories of my beautiful boy. It was totally worth it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Connie Baack,08/09/2024,"I received my Cuddle Clone of my cat Jaxie on Monday, December 4, 2023. I was a little nervous when I was opening the package to see what the Cuddle Clone looked like compared to how my cat Jaxie actually looked. I am so thrilled with the final product. The face is not exact, but Jaxie had some very strange markings, and I think they did a good job considering. The body is perfection. The size, texture of the fur, the color, the length of the fur, and the markings down the back all the way to the end of the tail are absolutely remarkable. Jaxie had a very, very full mane and was a very large cat, 30 pounds at his highest weight, and the Clone looks great! The pose in the reclining position with Jaxie’s head staring forward is so lifelike it makes me gasp at times. I am so happy with the finished product that I am making sure to take lots of pictures of my other two cats, because at some point when they are gone, I will want to do a Cuddle Clone of them as well. This is a perfect gift to give to anyone who has a special pet and wants it memorialized. I am so glad I had this Cuddle Clone made of my sweet Jaxie.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Therese Brosmer,08/09/2024,"Baby Girl was a stowaway traveling with her brother from the east coast to Colorado when they were kittens. She first chose my Fiance back when we were still friends. She was only the size of his palm. How could he resist? Through thick and thin Baby Girl was always there! From traveling to camping to hotels, she always seemed up for a new adventure! Our family and friends called her a forever kitten, because although she had a long just over 13 years with us. She wasn't very big. Larger than a kitten and smaller than other fully grown cats. We lost our beautiful girl to degenerative spine disease. Shortly after her passing I looked into Cuddle Clones here. The artist did a wonderful job! They got extremely close to our girl. This clone is twice the size Baby Girl was and the marks and ears are slightly different. Overall this clone is so close it reminds me of our girl and even confuses my eldest daughters cat Wittles. The artist did a wonderful job! Please thank them for us! The first photo is the clone and the second is our Baby Girl.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sarah Giddens,08/09/2024,"I lost my best friend, Dave, a few weeks ago. My childhood dream was to have an orange cat and Dave was more than fulfilling. When he passed, I asked the vet for a clipping of his beautiful orange fur. The cuddle clone looks exactly like him and after placing his fur inside the special pocket and his collar on him, his presence was with us once again. It felt like holding my boy. This was the most amazing gift and I will cherish him forever! I couldn’t recommend this more. It’s absolutely worth the price and the wait.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Laura Mills,08/09/2024,"Wow!! 🤩🥲🥹 I'm immediately blown away and so happy with the result of my CuddleClone of my cat Binx. Thank you so much CuddleClones for doing such an amazing job at having the clone look identical to my cat Binx; it is beautiful! 😍🥰 Binx was adopted from my local animal shelter in 2014 when she was 4 years old, she was the best decision my family and I could've made of adopting her, and would make that decision 1000+ times over. She was one of the best parts of my life for almost the last 10 years I have a lot of milestones within that time that she got to go through with me to remember and cherish forever. Her death was both unexpected and rapid, and was challenging to process all those feelings of grief, and still can be difficult at particular times too, but having at least Binx immortalized visually can help me to continue working through the grief process. She will forever be with me and in my heart, and I cannot thank her enough for choosing me and my family. She will be eternally missed and cherished, forever and always. Please if you are considering getting one for yourself, a friend, a family member, etc. run don't walk to your photo library to get this; I promise you will not regret it!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Finley,08/09/2024,"Mid-April 2024 I noticed my sweet baby kitty Leo acting a bit off. We took him to the vet and less than ten days later he was diagnosed with multiple myeloma, an incurable and vicious cancer. I ordered my cuddle clone of Leo knowing I didn’t have long left with him. I’m autistic, and he is my emotional support cat and very best friend. The diagnosis was particularly devastating because in September 2020, Leo was diagnosed with a feline injection site sarcoma, another form of cancer. As a result, he needed to get his hind leg amputated at the hip, and he beat that cancer and was happy and seemingly healthy. He went downhill very quickly and passed away May 17. Ordering my Cuddle Clone was easy and the customization process allowed me to get all of Leo’s little details and quirks. The customer service was prompt, courteous, and helpful. Fulfillment came quicker than I expected, and he was shipped with care. As for the Cuddle Clone. My boy looks beautiful. His fur patterns are perfect, his facial expression is spot-on, and the attention to detail is amazing. His form is perfect, which is difficult considering the fact he was a tripod. They even captured his little toe beans that I loved so dearly. I attached pictures but did not expect anything significant because he was already such a unique cat and his beans were no exception. They got his markings on his BEANS. That’s how detailed Cuddle Clones is. He has the same heart-shaped marking on his chest (absolutely PERFECT). This is particularly impressive because I selected to have a zipper pouch on the chest, but it’s done so well you can hardly see it. When I opened my Cuddle Clone, I recorded my reaction knowing it would be emotional, and I was so delightfully surprised, impressed, and touched by the care given to my Leo. My family members and even cats have done a double take when “Leo” is sitting in one of his usual spots, with his collar on. It’s very comforting to have a reminder of my dearest friend in his healthy state in his favorite places, and to be able to give him hugs when I miss him. Overall I could not be more impressed and I’d like to thank the team at Cuddle Clones for giving me a beautiful reminder of my goodest boy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Aaron Lee,08/09/2024,"My 13 year old tortie girl, Cooper, passed about a month ago and my amazing partner got this for me. My cat had been sick for a long time and I spent a lot of time taking care of her. We spent the weekend after she died picking out our favorite photos of her while reminiscing, and he submitted them. When we took her out of the package we were instantly impressed with how well they captured my cat’s essence. Tortoiseshells can have complex coat coloring with intricate patterns. The artist who made mine did a wonderful job of picking out the features that really make it look like Cooper, including ones I didn’t think to specifically ask for, like the dark orange stripes on her face and her striped tail. I’m really happy with how it came out. It looks so much like her. I opted for the pouch and her ashes are tucked inside. It’s much nicer to hug the cuddle clone than trying to hug a wooden urn. The house feels a little less empty, and I like when I see the cuddle clone. Most often I look at this and remember how cute she was, and all of our happy times in my home.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Deborah Ennis,08/09/2024,My granddaughter is going to love this - she misses her cat very much!!! It is as close to real as you can get. It scared the heck out of my own cat🤣,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cathy DeBiase,08/09/2024,I found the quality to be very good. The color could have been a little darker & a bit more white by the nose but otherwise it's very good. My other cat thinks he has his buddy back & sleeps by it everyday. All who see it are amazed by the likeness. Thank you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Lilly CatMom,08/09/2024,It was worth the wait! I wasn’t prepared for it to be so realistic. I am still getting used to it; it’s only been a few months since my beloved cat's passing. I recommend this for anyone who wants a loving pet memorial to keep their ashes in and memorialize. Our other cat thought it was him and even started grooming it! The picture of the cat on the cat climber is our beloved pet. The others are the cuddle clone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Debi Schneiderwind,08/09/2024,"I ordered a cuddle clone after I lost my 18-year old cat, Kiki. They captured her likeness quite well, the attention to detail in her markings is terrific and they included her shorter tail! My only criticism is that her neck is awkwardly long for an American shorthair cat. If it was more compact it would be a better resemblance. I sent lots of photos but would recommend being really specific on details! All in all, I am happy with my cat from Cuddle Clones! It’s a very high quality plush and I’m glad I purchased it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
David Biagi,08/09/2024,"I just got my pixie back and I was so nervous to open it not sure if they would do him justice, but they did an amazing job and it’s even closer to him than I ever could have imagined!

Kristine E Warren,08/09/2024,"I absolutely love this! Such a comfort to have an essentially life size replica of my boy to watch over me like he used to. Albeit without the charm of his perpetual meowing.Initially it was a little eerie seeing my Mr. Nach come out of the box \stuffed\"". I don't think it's possible to avoid that uncanny valley feeling at first. There's always going to be something off about an inanimate object trying to replicate life 1 to 1. But they did such a great job with his position",shape,size,and coloring. Nacho was a tripod and the clone sits with his little back leg sticking out just like his used to. The air brushing (or however they color the fur idk) pattern is realistic enough that it catches me off guard sometimes when I see it. Makes it feel like Nacho is still just chilling there,like he had for 18 years. It's soft and cuddly,"but a bit firm so it holds its shape. I also love that they add the whiskers including the ones by his eyes! The only things that would make it more perfect would be if they could somehow add soft squishy little rubber/silicone/whatever toes to the bottom of the paws. I miss his toe beans <3. Or maybe even a sound box where you could add audio of his meows and put in the zipper pouch.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Judi W,08/09/2024,"I love my Cuddle Clone of my sweet Harley. He was such a unique looking cat so I was concerned that he wouldn't look right. I was hoping for ok but he looks AMAZING!

AC Mihail,08/09/2024,"After we lost our beautiful boy Gucci Mane to abdominal tumors, I wanted to purchase a Cuddle Clone in his likeness. The craftspersons responsible for his effigy outdid themselves, and although we’ll always miss our handsome cat and his one of a kind personality, this has really helped process the loss, and to remind us of the years we spent as his people. Thank you again, we’re truly touched. They got his two white toes spot on! Oh and his brother Gunther seems to be happy to have him around again, too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Zamboni's Momma,08/09/2024,"My cat, Zamboni, was my soulmate; the love of my life. I lost him in February 2023 (after 15 years together). I had always wanted a stuffed replica of him even before he passed. So, this was a Christmas gift to myself. The clone in these pictures is version #2. I was heartbroken when the first version arrived and looked nothing like Zamboni. When I contacted Cuddle Clones and explained how sad and unhappy I was, they offered to revise him. This one is a much better likeness and I really do love him. Thank you, Cuddle Clones, for your understanding and excellent communication. My Zamboni Cuddle Clone brings me peace and comfort every day.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lotta Pursiainen,08/09/2024,"We got a plushie made of our cat who just recently passed away. The face isn't very accurate, but the rest of the body is pretty good. We showed the plush to our other cat, she was kind of scared and first and thought it was a real cat! It didn't take very long for her to warm up to it. I think it has actually helped her get some closure about what happened to her sister, she spends a lot of time laying around it and even sleeps next to it sometimes. I'd say it was definitely worth it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Elizabeth Lack,08/09/2024,"I contacted you all for a cuddle clone of my cat that I’d had for 12 years, he lost his battle with kidney disease the end of January.

I love it so much,honestly he’s my kittys clone❤️❤️❤️💯💯💯",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Shana Pau,08/09/2024,"CuddleClones created a great cat plushie that is quite similar to my tabby cat, Jack. My CuddleClone actually looks very lifelike but without knowing Jack in person, it would be almost impossible to sew a plushie. However, the painting of his stripes is spot on from the photos I sent. I love my CuddleClone very much. It is so comforting seeing a cat-shape just laying on my desk or couch and reminds me how much Jack was in my life. Thank you for this adorable remembrance of my beloved cat ❤️",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

erica burger baillif,08/09/2024,I love our Sam cuddle clone. It's a welcome to have her back in our lives after losing her to complications of cancer. The artist captured her face pattern perfectly.

Laurie,08/09/2024,Looks soo good and so much better than the first try. I had to send it back for a refund because he didn’t look like my cat.. but the second one I ordered looks sooo much better.. almost exact replica.. my daughter just got. Really late Xmas present.. u have to be patient bc it takes a long time! I’ve been waiting since sept and it’s now Feb!

Rescued some 10 years ago a just a feral baby herself facing the harsh weather elements it took a couple of years for this special kitty to like us. Buy boy when she did she poured her little heart out❤️my daughter saw a Cuddle Clone ad and immediately wanted one when Momma passed. She used all her own money saved from her grandparents to purchase this clone. The likeness is astounding, the quality is amazing and the staff are ever so friendly. Thank you Cuddle Clones.

Nina L,08/09/2024,"Words cannot describe how happy and sad I felt at the same time when my cuddle clone arrived. I lost my Amber; my tiny little valkyrie lady to FIP in December 4th of last year. I have been in such loss and grief, both me and my fiance lost her to this disease at a young age of 6 months old and now I'm crying just writing this. I hugged my cuddle clone Amber and cried once more because she looked exactly the same, but her eyes vibrant before she fell to this illness, this disease that kills so many cats. I feel so happy to see her again and tell others of her story and how she impacted our lives. She was a brave strong little lady and now every night eventhough she is gone forever, she has left paw prints in our hearts and my other two cats whom miss her as well. I hug my cuddle clone and tell her I miss her always. Her spirit will always be there with us, and now her clone will be a reminder of all the happiness she gave us. Thank you foe all the hard work you did to bring her to life again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Terri Wilbanks,08/09/2024,She’s perfect! I lost my 15 year old cat in May and being over 70 will not get another one. After crying every day for 6 months I decided to do Cuddle Clones. I feel like she is with me again! Santa brought her to me and when my 6 year old granddaughter opened it she screamed “it’s Jazzie!” She was not uniform in color at all but you all nailed it to perfection. Thank you so much. The order was processed so quickly and you kept me updated all the way. Awesome company!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I just can't fully express my joy and awe at this artfully done, loving tribute to my Sabastian! It's so life like that I expect him to reach out and pull me over to give him loving! Even my Aussie thought it was real!!! Some folks thought it was the real Sabastian and had gone to a taxidermy place. When I said no this was done from pictures of him, they were utterly amazed! This was after they thought it was a real cat! All I can say is thank you and...... WOW!!!!!!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Annette Georgakis,08/09/2024,"I cannot explain how emotional I was to receive my CuddleClone of my beloved cat Monty who I lost due to old age (almost 17) last year after having him since he was 14 weeks old. Losing him still feels so raw and has left such a huge hole in my life. I am in awe of the likeness and how amazing it feels to cuddle him once again. I cannot thank the artists enough for the beautiful work they have done. He’s so much more lifelike than I could have imagined. My heart is so full of love all over again. I would say that there is a slight discrepancy with the colour of his fur just around his mouth and at the very end of his tail (it’s a bit too white), but I couldn’t bear to send him back now. I’m so in love with him and everything else is just perfect. Would absolutely recommend CuddleClones! I’m honestly so thrilled.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When he passed, I asked the vet for a clipping of his beautiful orange fur. The cuddle clone looks exactly like him and after placing his fur inside the special pocket and his collar on him, his presence was with us once again. It felt like holding my boy. This was the most amazing gift and I will cherish him forever! I couldn’t recommend this more. It’s absolutely worth the price and the wait.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Annette Georgakis,08/08/2024,"I cannot explain how emotional I was to receive my CuddleClone of my beloved cat Monty who I lost due to old age (almost 17) last year after having him since he was 14 weeks old. Losing him still feels so raw and has left such a huge hole in my life. I am in awe of the likeness and how amazing it feels to cuddle him once again. I cannot thank the artists enough for the beautiful work they have done. He’s so much more lifelike than I could have imagined. My heart is so full of love all over again. I would say that there is a slight discrepancy with the colour of his fur just around his mouth and at the very end of his tail (it’s a bit too white), but I couldn’t bear to send him back now. I’m so in love with him and everything else is just perfect. Would absolutely recommend CuddleClones! I’m honestly so thrilled.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
isabella holden,08/08/2024,"i lost my cat in february and my friend got me a clone as a present. while a few things are off since he had to be secretive about it i’m still so beyond happy with my plush. the only thing that is off is my cat reef had half a tail since it was amputated and my friend did not know this, his eyes are also a little green but other than that it’s actually perfect. the patterns are spot on. i’m in love 😭 thank you so so much for helping me on my grieving journey. i highly recommend this.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Krysta Valdovinos,08/08/2024,Never in a million years would I have imagined how perfect this replica would be. I was afraid to place an order but I am so glad that I did. When I opened my package it brought me to tears. I felt like I had my boy back in my arms. 10/10 I would recommend this company!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bri Becker,08/08/2024,I want to say thank you for everything that you've done to make my beloved cat of 19 years be life like again! I'm so happy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Julianne,08/08/2024,I want to thank cc so much for doing my beloved service/therapy cat Trebenski. I requested he be made 24” because Trebenski and all the other Tom’s I’ve had seem to be extra large boys. I am over joyed with the out come! Yes he is big but Trebenski was this size or bigger before he lost most of his weight because his kidneys were failing. You can see my other boy Willy in the photo beside the plush and he is massive as well. The plush is actually a bit smaller than him. I highly recommend cuddle clones and will always give them 5 stars! Thank you so much!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Debi Schneiderwind,08/08/2024,"I ordered a cuddle clone after I lost my 18-year old cat, Kiki. They captured her likeness quite well, the attention to detail in her markings is terrific and they included her shorter tail! My only criticism is that her neck is awkwardly long for an American shorthair cat. If it was more compact it would be a better resemblance. I sent lots of photos but would recommend being really specific on details! All in all, I am happy with my cat from Cuddle Clones! It’s a very high quality plush and I’m glad I purchased it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mary Gellott,08/08/2024,"My first born cat bunny, died this year at 20 years old. I just had to have her home with me so I had a cuddle clone crafted of her. It’s so perfect it’s so amazing. It’s startling to see her back home on the bed where she belongs. I would give this 10 stars if I could. Thank you for bringing bunny home to me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Kristine E Warren,08/08/2024,"I absolutely love this! Such a comfort to have an essentially life size replica of my boy to watch over me like he used to. Albeit without the charm of his perpetual meowing.Initially it was a little eerie seeing my Mr. Nach come out of the box \stuffed\"". I don't think it's possible to avoid that uncanny valley feeling at first. There's always going to be something off about an inanimate object trying to replicate life 1 to 1. But they did such a great job with his position",shape,size,and coloring. Nacho was a tripod and the clone sits with his little back leg sticking out just like his used to. The air brushing (or however they color the fur idk) pattern is realistic enough that it catches me off guard sometimes when I see it. Makes it feel like Nacho is still just chilling there,like he had for 18 years. It's soft and cuddly,"but a bit firm so it holds its shape. I also love that they add the whiskers including the ones by his eyes! The only things that would make it more perfect would be if they could somehow add soft squishy little rubber/silicone/whatever toes to the bottom of the paws. I miss his toe beans <3. Or maybe even a sound box where you could add audio of his meows and put in the zipper pouch.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Finley,08/08/2024,"Mid-April 2024 I noticed my sweet baby kitty Leo acting a bit off. We took him to the vet and less than ten days later he was diagnosed with multiple myeloma, an incurable and vicious cancer. I ordered my cuddle clone of Leo knowing I didn’t have long left with him. I’m autistic, and he is my emotional support cat and very best friend. The diagnosis was particularly devastating because in September 2020, Leo was diagnosed with a feline injection site sarcoma, another form of cancer. As a result, he needed to get his hind leg amputated at the hip, and he beat that cancer and was happy and seemingly healthy. He went downhill very quickly and passed away May 17. Ordering my Cuddle Clone was easy and the customization process allowed me to get all of Leo’s little details and quirks. The customer service was prompt, courteous, and helpful. Fulfillment came quicker than I expected, and he was shipped with care. As for the Cuddle Clone. My boy looks beautiful. His fur patterns are perfect, his facial expression is spot-on, and the attention to detail is amazing. His form is perfect, which is difficult considering the fact he was a tripod. They even captured his little toe beans that I loved so dearly. I attached pictures but did not expect anything significant because he was already such a unique cat and his beans were no exception. They got his markings on his BEANS. That’s how detailed Cuddle Clones is. He has the same heart-shaped marking on his chest (absolutely PERFECT). This is particularly impressive because I selected to have a zipper pouch on the chest, but it’s done so well you can hardly see it. When I opened my Cuddle Clone, I recorded my reaction knowing it would be emotional, and I was so delightfully surprised, impressed, and touched by the care given to my Leo. My family members and even cats have done a double take when “Leo” is sitting in one of his usual spots, with his collar on. It’s very comforting to have a reminder of my dearest friend in his healthy state in his favorite places, and to be able to give him hugs when I miss him. Overall I could not be more impressed and I’d like to thank the team at Cuddle Clones for giving me a beautiful reminder of my goodest boy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Zamboni's Momma,08/08/2024,"My cat, Zamboni, was my soulmate; the love of my life. I lost him in February 2023 (after 15 years together). I had always wanted a stuffed replica of him even before he passed. So, this was a Christmas gift to myself. The clone in these pictures is version #2. I was heartbroken when the first version arrived and looked nothing like Zamboni. When I contacted Cuddle Clones and explained how sad and unhappy I was, they offered to revise him. This one is a much better likeness and I really do love him. Thank you, Cuddle Clones, for your understanding and excellent communication. My Zamboni Cuddle Clone brings me peace and comfort every day.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While it's impossible to make an exact replica out of fabric and cloth, y'all were able to capture his essence and likeness pretty well. Even my other cat did a double take when she saw the replica of her brother.Thank you for the comfort brought by this company.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pattie Hinkley,08/08/2024,"Many years ago I purchased a Cuddle Clone for my daughter after she lost her cat and it was just so beautiful. So when my Happy went to Rainbow Bridge I decided to purchase a Cuddle Clone of him to help me with my grief. I want to say thank you so very much to the amazing artists who recreated my precious Happy in such amazing detail. From his big front paws, to his curled tail the details were on point. They worked with me throughout the process to make sure everything was perfect. Even his soul mate Harley Quinn liked his clone, and I was very happy about that. I have him currently sitting in his favorite cat house and everyday I say hi and give him a pat on the head it has been wonderful. I know I won't ever have him back but I'm thankful to the Cuddle Clones company that I have something that I can hold and enjoy remembering all the memories of my beautiful boy. It was totally worth it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
S.M.,08/08/2024,My daughter dramatically lost her baby (cat) a year ago. She has had a hard time with the loss. I did the Cuddle Clone for her birthday. It came when she was out of town. When she came back her “baby” was awaiting her. She loved it!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Lilly CatMom,08/08/2024,It was worth the wait! I wasn’t prepared for it to be so realistic. I am still getting used to it; it’s only been a few months since my beloved cat's passing. I recommend this for anyone who wants a loving pet memorial to keep their ashes in and memorialize. Our other cat thought it was him and even started grooming it! The picture of the cat on the cat climber is our beloved pet. The others are the cuddle clone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Kate,08/08/2024,Thank you so much cuddle clones for this amazing clone of my cat who passed away a couple of years ago!!! The clone is perfect and made me so happy!!!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Elizabeth,08/08/2024,"I adore my Cuddle Clone of my sweet Ham. He was my best friend and chronic illness companion for twelve wonderful years. Tragically, I lost him on June 7, 2024, at 1:43 pm, \I love you\"" time. My heart has been shattered since and my grief heavy and overwhelming. I was very nervous creating my order with all the details I included",and even though my Cuddle Clone isn't perfect,it doesn't need to be. He is perfect to me and so beautiful. I constantly stare at his face because it resembles Ham and brings tears to my eyes constantly. Ham also had a very complex marble fur pattern and the artists did a beautiful job capturing the beauty and sweetness of my boy. My forever sunshine. And as a big stuffed animal collector and enjoyer,I love having my sweet boy to cuddle every night,just like we used to together when he was here. I even place my Cuddle Clone on my pillow,"Ham's favorite place to sleep. Thank you so much Cuddle Clones for bringing my sweet boy home. <3""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The only thing that could have been done better was Micah had a bit longer muzzle then the boxer head they had used. Other then that, and my pickiness, I was very happy with the results. It brings me alittle comfort having the presence they did well to create.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Erika,08/04/2024,"At first I was a little iffy on it. The markings matched 100%, they got his pose down to a T, they even got his one bent ear and one straight ear absolutely accurate... I set it on my bed and went to get a drink of water, and when I returned I thought, \Oh","there's my boy!\"" ...Only it wasn't him",it was the plush. Now every time I see it,I freak out thinking it really is my pup. I like to put him in places my real boy can never get to because it also freaks out my mom and she can't understand how my dog got up on the fridge or how he's laying in her bathtub. 10/10. I love this plush. PS - my dog is not pleased with his clone,he gets mad when I give it any attention and he barks at it. But they DO look adorable together when I can get him to be near it!

It felt like he was in my arms once again! I am amazed at the talent of Bijou’s designer. He is perfect, from his beautiful brown eyes and silky light hair right down to his little “nub” tail! Thank you so much for taking time to capture the essence of Bijou. His ashes are secured in his little underbelly zippered pocket. I’m sure if he could he would give an enthusiastic paws up for the care and craftsmanship that was given to his new “body” that his mom can cuddle again. Many thanks! 🩵",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mindy,07/17/2024,"I lost my best friend, side kick, soulmate - my everything, Layla 2 weeks ago. I rescued her when she was 6 months and lost her at 14 years. The grief and emptiness in the house has been unbearable. I read all the reviews of others that have been through the same devastation and my mom and I decided to rush order a cuddle clone of Layla. When I saw the postal service pull up my heart started racing. Upon opening the package I could not contain my emotions. Wow. I thought I would be so sad, yet the second I picked her up I was so comforted and cried in a joyful way. We spent an hour looking at her from all angles and could not believe the likeness. The attention to all the detail, her unique markings, her eyes. I cannot thank you all enough for the love that obviously was put in to making Layla so true to who she was. Her ears, eyes. Wow. Of course nothing can ever replace the joyful best friend we lost- yet having this clone to fill that empty space offers such a sense of comfort. Anyone who is considering and has lost their beloved pet- 100 percent worth it. Thank you to the designer who captured my girl. You are a great company. Thank you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Kristin Clary,07/10/2024,"With the price of the product, I was hesitant to order. I figured with the return policy that it would be worth the risk, as I had lost my best friend and soul mate of 14 years, Oliver. I was heartbroken and found myself feeling just empty with only a box of ashes left from his life. So I took the plunge and ordered a Cuddle Clone. I'm very pleased with what arrived on my doorstep today! It's not an absolute carbon copy (I didn't expect it to be) but it's pretty dang close. They even got some of the smaller details, like the white circles around his eyes, and his fangs (though I did request that they pay attention to that detail specifically). I submitted a little under 20 photos if I remember correctly, for them to work from. I chose the option to have a zipper pouch installed, and I'm so glad I did. I was able to put my boy's ashes in there, and holding his plush replica is so much more comforting than holding a box. It will never replace what I lost, but, it will bring me comfort in the form of something physical to hold that reminds me of my best friend. Thank you!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Susanne,07/09/2024,"It’s adorable. It’s a bit broader around the neck, and I expected the freckles to be difficult to capture, but I still absolutely love it 💕 I’m currently waiting for another plush, of my old dog. I’m sad, because I had to let her rest forever yesterday. This cheered me up. Thank you💕",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rachel,07/09/2024," My soulmate dog passed away too soon from cancer, and I’ve been heartbroken. I ordered a cuddle clone of her one night in a grief-driven fit after spending a week reading reviews and being on the fence. The bad experiences I read made me nervous, and I was so worried her clone wouldn’t look anything like her, or that it’d feel cheap and stiff. The opposite was true. CC did a really nice job making a stuffy that looked like my girl. They got all the details right, even some tail details that I didn’t describe very clearly. Having this stuffed animal has been a huge comfort. I’ve held it during my saddest moments, and just hope she holds up to the sadness wear-and-tear. The only downside is that it looks so similar, that my partner and I get confused when we see “her” out of the corner of our eye and it can bring up some sadness. But the comfort far outweighs that. If this is within your budget and you’re considering, I would recommend ordering from them. I miss my girl so much, and having a stuffy clone really helps.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is particularly impressive because I selected to have a zipper pouch on the chest, but it’s done so well you can hardly see it. When I opened my Cuddle Clone, I recorded my reaction knowing it would be emotional, and I was so delightfully surprised, impressed, and touched by the care given to my Leo. My family members and even cats have done a double take when “Leo” is sitting in one of his usual spots, with his collar on. It’s very comforting to have a reminder of my dearest friend in his healthy state in his favorite places, and to be able to give him hugs when I miss him. Overall I could not be more impressed and I’d like to thank the team at Cuddle Clones for giving me a beautiful reminder of my goodest boy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Joni Sackrider,07/06/2024,"I can't say enough. They are amazing, my princess fought cancer for 3 years. I found out about cuddle clones and had her 'cloned' while she was still here. Having 'pookie' after her loss 4 weeks ago certainly helped me so much. They captured the essence of her, that amazed me. The expression, the look, it was her pre-cancer. I love being able to hold her when i am missing her so much. They even got the pink of the inside of her ears correct. I highly recommend!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Veronica,07/05/2024,He looks so much like Einstein but a plushy of him.. My sister absolutely loved it she will have him forever now... Thank you so much for making this beautiful plush of Einstein.. Sister loves how even the inside of his ears look like his. RIP Einstein 🙏 THANK YOU CUDDLE CLONES..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jessica Barkman,07/04/2024,I cant tell you how happy I am with my order.

Thank you so much!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Lesley Shores,07/01/2024,"I ordered a Cuddle Clone for my niece and her two daughters who recently lost their sweet Baby. She was a very unique looking dog and Cuddle Clones captured her perfectly.

Donna Suerth,06/30/2024,My cuddle clone really looks like a smaller version of my dog daughter! I wanted one while she was here so I’ll always have it to cuddle when she’s no longer here to hug. Really well done.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
L.,06/26/2024," I ordered my Cuddle Clone of Leah, my senior Pomeranian, last September and it arrived on October 13th. Leah could figure out why it wouldn't play with her! My darling Leah passed last Mobday, June 17th, 2024, and her Cuddle Clone has definitely gotten a lot of cuddling, though not for the first couple of days after we buried her. She is buried right beside Pearl, her Mama, who passed on October 18th, 2019, in our little pet cemetary in the backyard. In truth, \Leah 2\"" has been very therapeutic for me.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I will be giving this clone to her fur daddy on Father's day (tomorrow) He is suffering from great grief, I hope this will help to remind him of all the great times they had together.

Customer,06/15/2024,"My husband is not easily impressed when it comes to creating likeness’ of his Sophie, we’ve had artwork done but he says it never really captures her. Losing her this year was a terrible shock for us - he got Sophie when he was in high school and diagnosed with a chronic illness. She was what kept him going and got him on his feet again, and they were inseparable from that point. She always was closest when he was sick or sad to bring him the support and love he needed. It was all too fitting that she arrived in the mail this year while he was in the hospital having an emergency surgery. Sophie came home in more ways than one, and he finally says someone got her right.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

His snout isn’t as long as Sam’s was ( cuddle clones offered to fix him or refund my money) it has his cute little freckles on it.

E.M.W.,06/01/2024,My clone looks just like my baby when she was younger. It feels like she is there with me again. I miss her every day and having the clone helps. I can’t thank this company enough for the time and effort put in as well as the attention to detail.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jennifer Harper,06/01/2024,"Our dog recently passed away and my daughter asked if she could have a Lola stuffie. I was hesitant at first because of the cost, but I am so happy I ordered one for her. We just received it today and it is so perfect. From the coloring on her paws to her little nub of a tail to her laying in the exact position she always laid in, I could not be any happier. Definitely worth the price to see the look on my daughter's face when we opened the package.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Darlene,06/01/2024,You guys did an amazing job you my beloved Bentley. It was perfect in every way. I love it and it looks and feels so real and looks just like my boy. I couldn’t be happier with this purchase. Thank you so much,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

kathie tempinski,05/31/2024,"You guys are amazing! Looks so much like my boy Max. You have no idea how this helps the grieving process of losing my beautiful boy Max. He was 14 years old and he died of cancer. He had cancer on his foot after a long year and a half of caring for him. I had to let him go, and I didn’t want to. I’m so grateful that your company exists and you guys have great customer service and support. I love my cuddle clone. Thank you so much",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BK,05/31/2024,"Maddie was a pretty unusual shade of ginger, and I wasn’t sure how her fur would look on a Cuddle Clone. I had no reason to worry because it turned out to be her exact same color! I appreciate the details and markings and all the care that went into making this. My only suggestion has to do with the packaging—my CC came in a bag, not a box, so it was pretty misshapen when it got to me. I was able to mold it back, and now it feels like Maddie is still around. Thank you!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

STACEY ELLIS,05/31/2024,"My daughter recently lost her 13 year old boxer, Bowe. It broke all of our hearts. I had actually already ordered this but had sent it back for some touch ups. We got it back this past week. They did such a good job. They were great to work with. They made it just like I wanted. We gave it to my daughter and her family last night. They all loved it. Their other dog, Obi was trying to get to it. I think he actually thought it was Bowe. 😥",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
D.P.,05/31/2024,I just wanted to thank the artists again for recreating my fur baby who recently passed. I love him more & more each day. He truly helps my heart.

At 34, I’ve found it quite impossible to let her go and wake up crying just about every day and night since she’s passed. This cuddle clone has given a HUGE sense of comfort, and the resemblance is amazing. So happy with this and would purchase all over again. It’s not the same as Luna, however it feels so great to be able to honor her likeness and cuddle her tightly like we did daily.

I have decided to order a cuddle clone to have a unique memoir of him and to help me cope with the loss. He has arrived today and I am absolutely delighted and too stunned to speak! Frankly, I was tearing up when I unpacked my order because my plushie looks so real - it feels like my beloved furbaby finally came back home to be held in my arms again. It’s even better than I expected. Thanks to everyone who was working on my order to make this possible. The attention to detail is immaculate! It’s definitely worth placing an order if you’re considering it! 🥹🫶🏻",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Teresa Gamble,05/18/2024,I am absolutely blown away by how much it looks like my sweet boy Chaos. I had to save up for a while to be able to afford one. I received my cuddle clone on a very hard day so it lifted me up so much. I just lost a second cat and received my clone after I picked the ashes. I will save again to hopefully get one for the guy I just lost. My heart is broken again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Kristen Kim,05/18/2024,"I live far away from my Glissa for months at a time. I was really missing her, but when I got my Cuddle Clones Glissa, I felt she was with me again.

The hole in my heart was filled and it will tide me over until I can be with her again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Maureen Fudger,05/14/2024," It's 7 months since our near 18 year old Murphy, The Boss, passed away. He's in my every waking moment. We still have our other beloved rescue dogs & cats, but Murphy...His life force was so strong it just felt like a black void in our house without him. The Clone really got his eyes down perfectly; black, sparkling, Irish, lol. As rescuers we've been devastated by dozens of our pets passing. But Murphy was magical, a 60 pound Mutt from the shelter at 3 months old when we adopted him, born on the 4th of July 🐾💔 \Sometimes I Just Can't Wait To Get To Heaven.\"" -- Fannie Flagg","a great writer.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Laura Mills,05/14/2024,"Wow!! 🤩🥲🥹 I'm immediately blown away and so happy with the result of my CuddleClone of my cat Binx. Thank you so much CuddleClones for doing such an amazing job at having the clone look identical to my cat Binx; it is beautiful! 😍🥰 Binx was adopted from my local animal shelter in 2014 when she was 4 years old, she was the best decision my family and I could've made of adopting her, and would make that decision 1000+ times over. She was one of the best parts of my life for almost the last 10 years I have a lot of milestones within that time that she got to go through with me to remember and cherish forever. Her death was both unexpected and rapid, and was challenging to process all those feelings of grief, and still can be difficult at particular times too, but having at least Binx immortalized visually can help me to continue working through the grief process. She will forever be with me and in my heart, and I cannot thank her enough for choosing me and my family. She will be eternally missed and cherished, forever and always. Please if you are considering getting one for yourself, a friend, a family member, etc. run don't walk to your photo library to get this; I promise you will not regret it!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
natasha,05/13/2024,"But it is True! Cuddle Clones did an amazing job at replicating my sweet beagle boy Leo, that passed away just a few months shy of his 15th birthday, and I have been fortunate enough to have had him for 15 wonderful years.. Even though he can truly never be replaced, this is the next best thing out there! Thank You Cuddle Clones for being able to make this loss sting just a little less now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mary Hazelwood,05/09/2024,"My BamBam cuddle clone has helped me during this grieving time since he passed on 3/8/24. My cuddle clone is thicker than my BamBam but that's to be expected because he's a stuffed animal. When my BamBam was young, about 4 or 5, he weighed more and was thicker. So my cuddle clone is my BamBam when he was young and healthy. I love my cuddle clone more each day. I had BamBam 16 years so his passing hit me really hard. Cuddle Clones definitely helps. I do highly recommend.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Keyonna Davis,04/26/2024, I lost my soul dog 15 days ago and my world has completely fallen apart since. I paid the extra $100 for 2 week rush because I just couldn’t wait. The photos don’t even do it justice. My girl had a little black mole my her lip and an ‘x’ birthmark on her butt and both were identical on the stuffed animal. I immediately broke down when I opened this. I keep having to remind myself it’s not real and she’s gone every time I look over at it. So glad I did this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dayna P,04/26/2024,"CC did a beautiful job honoring our fur baby after we lost him earlier this year. He’s absolutely adorable, and we have a lovely tribute area for him. It’ll take some getting used to, because he looks so real. This is the closest way to feel like we can still hug him until we meet again under the rainbow bridge. I’m grateful for CC being around to help comfort my family because when I was little, there was nothing like it to help with the loss of a pet. This plush is a work of art and people need to understand, of course there are going to be small things you may notice that aren’t perfect. But you can’t duplicate perfection lol, you can, however, surely come close. I mean, wow! Thank you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Crystal Wheeler,04/18/2024,"Hi just wanted to say I received my cuddle clone of my baby girl Daizie. I lost her January 9, 2024, it was the hardest day of my life. She had an eye injury in December and was healing from that when an unexpected episode happened on New Year's Day, still not exactly sure what happened but she went down hill very quickly and I had to make that terrible decision, after having her as my little shadow for over 15yrs. A very close friend of mine told me she got a gift for me, because she knew our connection was extremely strong. She even told your company about how I would add a pop pf color to her tail and they captured her to a tee. I have her next to my bed in her bed and every so often I still think it is her when I walk in my room. Thank you so much.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It felt like we had our sweet Sunny back in our home and the room was filled with tears. The attention to detail was beyond my expectations and looked exactly like our real dog.

We are extremely happy with our purchase and couldn’t thank the Cuddle Clone team enough for working so hard to fill the hole in our hearts. ❤️",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Willow and Lakotas mum,03/07/2024,"After the loss of our precious babies I can’t explain the emptiness I felt. It was agonizing. I saw cuddle clones on the internet and thought I would get them back in just a small way. Nothing could ever compare to them but what I discovered when I received them was it helped with the empty feeling of wanting to hug and hold them..When I have really bad days of missing them, I just cuddle my clones until the tears stop. I definitely recommend them for anyone experiencing a very painful loss. The little added touch of their name on the tag was awesome…",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nancy Thorson,03/07/2024,I am very happy wih the clone I received of my dog that passed in November. The resemblance is so realistic my husband has had to do double takes to confirm the clone is not the real thing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dean Flowers,03/07/2024,"Aside from the spots missing on her snout of her nose, she's exactly as she was. Even how you got her grown out fur look and texture. The body fur colors were exact.

B.B.,03/05/2024,"Our order took a little longer than predicted, but I think it is because our boy had such an intricate pattern. The wait was worth it.. our cuddle clone is perfect! Of course it is not an exact clone, but it is about 95% which is crazy! They even put wire in his tail so it would curl like our pup’s did. We got this for our son after our boy died far too early at 6 years old from an aggressive cancer. Our son loves him and we all feel like a small part of hearts are healing just having this around. I cannot say enough about how amazing the quality is. Absolutely worth the money and the wait to get it!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Megan Paulsen,03/03/2024,I order two pups for my boyfriend and his mom. Their family dog passed away unexpectedly so I thought I would give them a cuddle clone to remember her.

Sandy,02/27/2024,"I am sooo very pleased with my Sabastian Cuddle Clone! There are some little nuances which have been captured in my Cuddle Clone that made Sabastian Sabastian! I just can't fully express my joy and awe at this artfully done, loving tribute to my Sabastian! It's so life like that I expect him to reach out and pull me over to give him loving! Even my Aussie thought it was real!!! Some folks thought it was the real Sabastian and had gone to a taxidermy place. When I said no this was done from pictures of him, they were utterly amazed! This was after they thought it was a real cat! All I can say is thank you and...... WOW!!!!!!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thank you for bringing my Bo home.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rebecca Venard,02/22/2024,My dog came out perfectly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PF,02/20/2024, Asked Cuddle Clines to match out daughter’s white husky. They absolutely nailed the facial impression and ice blue eyes and body shape. They even got the tail shape and curve. Would have been perfect but they missed detail of the feet and made it only a white clump as opposed to demarcation of the toes. Overall worth the money. Not cheap but then quality isn’t. Thank you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Karma Rei,02/16/2024,My 15 year old kitty passed away and I was feeling so lost without her. I purchased a Cuddle Clones of her and I've been able to sleep a little better. It looks just like her and I couldn't be happier with the quality.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Diana OBrien,02/11/2024,"My dog of 17 years recently passed and I received a cuddle clone as a gift. This clone is exactly my dog. I cried when I received this.

Alisa,02/09/2024,"I bought this for my daughter because I know how much her kitty meant to her. She watched him be born and they grew up together. Houdini passed away a few years ago, he was a unique Ragdoll, so I thought this would be the perfect gift for my daughter. I was right, she opened the gift and she cried and held him. They did a pretty good job making him, the coloring on his body is a great match and we were very impressed. He even has a sewn in tag with his name on it ❤️. I have a feeling, by the time my daughter is a little old lady, she will have a collection of Cuddle Clones looking like all of the pets she will have through her lifetime.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
S.B.,02/08/2024,"I received my Luke today, I am amazed how perfect he is, from his belly hair to his ears to his tail. I hug him and feel I’m hugging my Luke again. Even the texture of his hair feels like Luke’s, THANK YOU CUDDLE CLONE❤️",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ashley,02/08/2024,Made for a lovely gift as my grandfather will be moving to assisted living soon and cannot take his beloved pet. This will not be able to replace his pet (who will still be coming for plenty of visits!) but we hope will bring him comfort.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Natalie Paladino,02/07/2024,"I love my Cuddle Clone of my soul dog, Cooper James. I spent 14 years with this little guy and I am heartbroken and lost without him.

Samantha Hughes,02/06/2024,The detail is amazing and the plush looks exactly like my dog we lost. I even had a request for them to color my dogs ears pink since I would always color her ears pink and they did a wonderful job replicating it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hugo Alarcon,02/05/2024,"Well anticipating the inevitable I purchased this Cuddle Clone for my girlfriend about two hours before her dog passed away. I had to go through all of my girlfriends Facebook pictures she had with her dog Hoon to get every picture required and it’s wasn’t easy, but in the end it was all worth it. I mean there are times I go over my girlfriend’s place and I walk in and her Cuddle Clone is standing on the bed and for a quick second I forget that it’s not real. Cuddle Clones really did a great job at capturing many of his characteristics and even when I stare at Hoon clone at times it really looks like him, my girlfriend loves him, it has definitely been a great comfort to her. Thanks again for providing this beautiful service for pet mourners.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Kenneth R McClamrock/Renee Spry,02/04/2024,He was amazing! Hachi was so realistic! We could have walked over to me. The quality of the materials are awesome. Best gift I’ve ever been given. Thank you Cuddle Clones,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thank you so much",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AC Mihail,02/01/2024,"After we lost our beautiful boy Gucci Mane to abdominal tumors, I wanted to purchase a Cuddle Clone in his likeness. The craftspersons responsible for his effigy outdid themselves, and although we’ll always miss our handsome cat and his one of a kind personality, this has really helped process the loss, and to remind us of the years we spent as his people. Thank you again, we’re truly touched. They got his two white toes spot on! Oh and his brother Gunther seems to be happy to have him around again, too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gerard E Sedlak,02/01/2024,"Hi, we lost our beloved beagle, Holly, at the beginning of December, getting the Cuddle Clone version brought some joy back.

Thank you!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Linda K Mason,01/31/2024,"The craftsmanship done on our basset hound, Hank, was wonderful! We lost him almost 2 years ago and he was almost completely white headed. I chose for a younger version of him. Thank you for giving us a special gift🥰",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mark,01/31/2024,"Our baby girl of 17 years passed away this year and we have been missing her dearly. Cuddle Clones appeared on my timeline and the timing was perfect. I was able to take advantage of the rush shipment and our clone even arrived early. I provided the best picture I could and the service team even took time to reply to inquires sent after the order was placed. I could not believe how accurate the clone was and when my wife opened it for Christmas, she had the same reaction I had. I will say that for about a week, she startled us when we walked into our room where she stays. It just looked that real. Even showing friends photos of her they think we got a new puppy. I hope to get one of my little buddy that passed away almost 10 years ago. Thanks for the great job and helping ease our pain.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Imane,01/30/2024,Thank you Cuddle Clones for bringing my car Lucky back to life!!! We miss him very much and my family is so thankful to have him with us forever now!!

He was the sweetest happiest dog that loved everyone he met, both human and animal! I’m so happy I had Cuddle Clones make a stuffed animal of my boy, the attention to detail is exceptional , especially since my guy was missing some of his lower teeth and they recreated it exactly like pictured with his little tongue hanging out . His facial expression looks so happy just like Santino always did. I also love that his name is on it, that was a nice added surprise🩷Thank you so much Cuddle Clones , I will cherish him forever!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When I got the plush pet sent back to my address, I was able to get all of the gifts wrapped and mailed out in time for Christmas. My parents beloved fur baby Jade passed away almost a year ago and they were missing her every day. When they open their packages on Christmas day, I was on video to catch their reactions. We ALL cried. They absolutely love \having\"" their baby back. Thank you for such great work!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Katie Jarvis,01/28/2024,"THANK YOU SO MUCH! I had to put my 13 year old English bulldog, Hana, down on the 8th of December and I couldn’t stop crying. My mom ordered a clone of her and it came perfectly on time on Christmas Eve! When I opened her, I started bawling because of how perfect the clone is and I made my family cry. Now every time it’s on my bed and I come back into my room, I jump because it looks so much like her. They even included her snaggle tooth. Found originally on Facebook, thank you so much for being legit!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Debi Schneiderwind,01/28/2024,"I ordered a cuddle clone after I lost my 18-year old cat, Kiki. They captured her likeness quite well, the attention to detail in her markings is terrific and they included her shorter tail! My only criticism is that her neck is awkwardly long for an American shorthair cat. If it was more compact it would be a better resemblance. I sent lots of photos but would recommend being really specific on details! All in all, I am happy with my cat from Cuddle Clones! It’s a very high quality plush and I’m glad I purchased it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She adores my wife, and does so much to bring smiles and happiness to my wife when we would doggy sit. The problem was when the doggy had to go home, my wife would get sad and a bit depressed asking me where’s her dog. Well our Winny Clone changed all that, she loves her clone, it sleeps with her, it sits with her watching television during the day. She still misses Winny, but our Winny clone is certainly the next best thing. The folks at Cuddle Clone are simply the best as well. Try the Bobble Heads, you can keep your Puppy with you on your desk at work. It’s adorable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Karen P.,01/27/2024,I love my cuddle clone! It holds a very special place in my heart as my dog has recently passed away. It’s like she is still here with me. Thank you for keeping her alive for me!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dan Joling,01/27/2024,"The first thing that my wife asked when she opened her present was if I had had Frankie (her dog) stuffed. The other issue is that she is always waiting for Frankie to move, describes the feeling as bitter sweet. I would say that Cuddle Clones nailed it!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Debra Hester,01/27/2024,I was amazed at how well they did the coloring of the dogs fur. It was to the tee! They captured the way Whoopi layed and it looked so real when I opened the package. I would recommend this to anyone. What a wonderful gift it was for me to give my daughter.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
B. Hollister,01/26/2024,My Cuddle Max is PERFECT!!! I can't express how much this means to me. My Max is nearing 16 and I was looking for a way to carry him with me. Cuddle Max has fulfilled that need in every way. And Cuddle Clones has done a magnificiant job in delivering. Cuddle Max looks just like my Max! They even asked for extra photos of his paws and confirmed with me if they could just use black for his back. I was impressed that they asked. Impressed and grateful. Thank you Cuddle Clones!!!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Philip,01/26/2024,You guys did such a wonderful job. And the Attention of the details are incredible. It looks exactly like my tucker dog. Thank you so much ❤️,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Kellie,01/26/2024,"I lost my heart dog, my soul dog in April 2023. Shortly after I began seeing CuddleClones advertisements on social media and decided to order. I could not be happier with my purchase. My Cuddle Clone is perfect and I’m so happy to have a place to store my angel dogs ashes. I changed my mind on a few details while I was waiting for my order to enter production and the customer service agent was so kind and let me know how cute he thought my dog was. I am forever grateful. Worth every penny.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tammy,01/25/2024,"Our boy passed 12/08/23. In a state of grief I ordered a cuddle clone just wanting to hug him again. As I was waiting for him to arrive I started having doubts on whether they’d be able to get his wiry, curly hair right or his color. He came out phenomenally. My family was in tears because it looks just like him. I would really like to commend the artists who put a lot of detail into him. From the slight Mohawk on his head, the darker fur on his back, to his tail. Amazing. No regrets.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Liz Atlan,01/24/2024,"I ordered a cuddle clone for my daughter, who moved away from home and was tremendously missing her dog. I couldn't believe how spot-on Cuddle Clones made this creation.

Sarah,01/23/2024,I got this cuddle clone for my wife as a surprise. The clone was of her pup who passed away a little while ago now but she’s still very much apart of our family and this was a perfect way to make sure that her legacy will continue! She was very happy with how it came out and has never seen anything like it was so grateful for her cuddle clone!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Leslie Rodrigues,01/23/2024,"Absolutely love my cuddle clone. It looks just like my dog. They even took the time to add in the little details that made her look unique. For example, they don’t usually do nails on the paws of the cuddle clones, but I told them how my dog had a missing nail with a noticeable pink mark on her paw. They took the time and used a pink marker to mark her missing nail, even though they don’t usually work on paws. I love my cuddle clone so much. I am a grown woman and still sleeping with it everynight. It feels like I am with my dog again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Anonymous,01/23/2024,I got this made for my sister in laws parents who lost their dog Delilah a year or so ago. When the received it they said it looked exactly like her and were amazed by it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I found the website hard to navigate but the customer service is superb. The item itself is well done and pays attention to every detail. It was a splurge price wise, but it’s a lovely keepsake to have, after losing our beloved pet.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jayde Keller,01/22/2024,"I'm only giving a 4 star and not five because some of my pet's markings are not there, otherwise, it's an amazing likeness and is super cute! Be sure to get good photos of your pets for reference. Would definitely recommend.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Michelle,01/21/2024,"My hubbie just opened his birthday present he knew he was getting but was still blown away! The fur, colors, texture and amount couldn’t be more perfect. The eye color was an exact match as well. It exceeded our expectations by a mile. We lost her on Memorial Day and it’s like we have her back. Way cheaper than having her stuffed but equally cherished.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Elise Hauser,01/20/2024,"Our son Kevin has a very special bond with our dog, Daisy. They sleep together most nights, but if Daisy gets off the bed for water or to cool down, Kevin will wake up anxious and panicked. We ordered the cuddle clone to stand in for Daisy when she just needs some space. Kevin knew instantly that his cuddle clone was “his Daisy Dog” and he showed it to her right away! We love it and it is truly a work of art!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sheri,01/19/2024," I had come across Cuddle Clones a few years ago when my girl was just recently parted from us, back in 2021, and I was interested in a clone at the time, but didn't think I was ready for it then. Now a few years later, while having had found my way back to Cuddle Clones for some other products I got for other folks in my family for Christmas, I figured I'd take a shot and go in for the clone of my girl. I was eagerly looking forward to receiving her from the moment I ordered - and now that she's here, I'm happy to say it was a shot worth taking! When I sit her in some spots around my home where she used to enjoy lounging, it almost seems like she's actually sitting there. Her clone's fur colors are very close to her actual fur colors, including various specific markings she had. (There were some small subtle differences like a bit extra tan colored fur by her ears that she didn't actually have and a few other insignificant differences.) Her clone's facial 'structure' isn't a *perfect* representation of her face - but, for a stuffed animal replica, it's really great! It certainly resembles her! Kudos to the artists and other folks that worked together to make her and send her back home! PS. The name tag is a nice touch!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

vicki richardson,01/16/2024,"My sister and her husband recently lost their eldest dog. She was like a child to them, and it was difficult for them. It made it even worse for my sister, as the event took place at the exact time we were gathered to lay our brother to rest. She didn’t even get to say goodbye, as she was here with family for my brother’s funeral. I wanted to give her something she could keep to give her a visual reminder. Something more than a picture. She just loved it! It was so touching. I couldn’t thank you enough for taking the time to capture her personality. They were amazed at the detail, and they will treasure it forever.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Terri Wilbanks,01/08/2024,She’s perfect! I lost my 15 year old cat in May and being over 70 will not get another one. After crying every day for 6 months I decided to do Cuddle Clones. I feel like she is with me again! Santa brought her to me and when my 6 year old granddaughter opened it she screamed “it’s Jazzie!” She was not uniform in color at all but you all nailed it to perfection. Thank you so much. The order was processed so quickly and you kept me updated all the way. Awesome company!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Katie B,01/08/2024,"I went into this process with low expectations. My babies are gone and it was difficult to find pictures of all the sides they wanted. We held our breath when opening the package. To our delight, our 2 boys were fantastic! They looked so much like them but just enough difference to know they weren’t real.

Shelly Cumming,01/05/2024,I bought the clone to help my elderly mother transition to not having our dog around when she moved into a care facility.

Rebekah Monroe,12/14/2023,We recently had to say a heartbreaking goodbye to our sweet miniature schnauzer that we had for 16 years. After his passing I immediately ordered a cuddle clone to help with my grief. It arrived a few days ago and it has literally taken my breath away. It looks EXACTLY like our pup down to the coloring in his fur and texture. It’s absolutely amazing. The detail and thoughtfulness is incredible. These artists gave me the greatest gift that I would have paid a million dollars for. The comfort it has given my family and I is truly priceless. Thank you so so much from the bottom of my heart.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Angie Paradise,12/13/2023," I Love my Cuddle Clone. They did a great job recreating his likeness. Its comforting to look over and still see my buddy sitting there in essence. He passed a few months ago. I also got the stash pocket option and keep a small fur clipping I got from the vet in it. There's room for more if you needed it. What finished him off for me was the embroidered tag with his name on it, I wasn't expecting it and it was a nice surprise. Last, he is stuffed pretty firm which for me is also a plus. Hes perfect for hugging on days you're really missing your buddy. He sits well and keeps his shape because of this. Now, Is it exact? No, but it's a stuffed animal. Does that make it bad? Also no. Don't go in expecting it to be and you to will absolutely love your Cuddle Clone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dina Bradshaw,12/12/2023,My cuddle clone was absolutely amazing. I couldn’t believe how wonderful it came out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cynthia Howell,12/10/2023,Roxy was 14 when I need ed to help her cross the Rainbow Bridge. It was a difficult choice to make but putting her through more test and treatments would be more for my sake and not her quality of life. It pained me greatly to let go. Shortly there after I started seeing adds for cuddle clones. After many tearful sleepless nights I decided to get. They did an amazing job and followed my notes in the comment section. I am forever grateful for having my model of Roxy. It helped my heart.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Connie Baack,12/10/2023,"I received my Cuddle Clone of my cat Jaxie on Monday, December 4, 2023. I was a little nervous when I was opening the package to see what the Cuddle Clone looked like compared to how my cat Jaxie actually looked. I am so thrilled with the final product. The face is not exact, but Jaxie had some very strange markings, and I think they did a good job considering. The body is perfection. The size, texture of the fur, the color, the length of the fur, and the markings down the back all the way to the end of the tail are absolutely remarkable. Jaxie had a very, very full mane and was a very large cat, 30 pounds at his highest weight, and the Clone looks great! The pose in the reclining position with Jaxie’s head staring forward is so lifelike it makes me gasp at times. I am so happy with the finished product that I am making sure to take lots of pictures of my other two cats, because at some point when they are gone, I will want to do a Cuddle Clone of them as well. This is a perfect gift to give to anyone who has a special pet and wants it memorialized. I am so glad I had this Cuddle Clone made of my sweet Jaxie.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jill,12/10/2023,I lost my pug Oliver 2 months ago. I was so nervous/excited to order. It was the best thing I ever did. It looks just like him. I can't stop petting him and kissing his head. He is perfect!! Thank you so much Cuddle Clones 🐾❤️,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Omar Lopez,12/09/2023,I truly loved the details on my Coddle Clone my dog name is Benz. I just recently had a major surgery and I had to do a long stay in the hospital.

The Coddle Clone help me nurse me mentally back to health.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Anne Keller,12/07/2023,This one is my daughter's dog - and I'm sure she'll cry when she sees it. I don't know how you do this but you've captured her so well. Hazel's still with us but won't always be. So glad you're here!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Myra E Luzardo,12/07/2023,My son is obsessed with our family dog. And when I saw Cuddle clones I knew I had To buy one. I was Worried at first because they don’t send you a peak into its progress or ask If any changes need to be made like most custom places but their product is so amazing and they are so confident that you’ll love it! Well I received my cycle clone and I was Not disappointed! It was a good sized clone and it looked just like my dog. So well made!! Highly recommend!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Georilisse Morales,12/02/2023,I cried for hours after receiving my cuddle clone. I had just turned two years since my dog died and I was obviously not over it. After opening the box and reading his name on the label I cried for hours. I was so happy but distraught at the same time. I was inconsolable because I thought I would never get to see him again. But this clone is the closest I got an it is spot on. They followed the directions to the ‘T’ and the eye for detail is impeccable. I love it. I take it with me every where. It’s smaller than him which makes it easier to take places. But I love it. Definitely a must just be emotionally prepared lol it almost looks real.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Deborah Ennis,12/02/2023,My granddaughter is going to love this - she misses her cat very much!!! It is as close to real as you can get. It scared the heck out of my own cat🤣,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Matt Roberts,11/30/2023,I am extremely pleased with the results! My dog is a Shitzu Yorkie (Shorkie) mix and was initially worried since there was no option from the plethora of selections available when I first submitted my order. But after receiving it I honestly was shocked to see how accurate it was! They even were able to add a few teeth that matched the slight underbite she has! I definitely must say the more pictures you can send them the better because the clone I received looks phenomenal!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Eva Manjarrez,11/30/2023,"I love my mini Leonard! family says he doesn't look like him, but I disagree obviously. his orange is a little faded, but it's fine. I love him regardless. they even got his crinkly ear! <3",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jennifer Sharp,11/30/2023,"I ordered this clone of my daughter’s cat Gracie, as a HS graduation gift for June ‘24. She loves her cat so much & is already talking about how much she is going to miss her next year when she’s away at college. I decided to take advantage of the offers & order it early. My plan was to hold on to it until June graduation, but when it arrived, I was blown away at the detail & craftsmanship. I was so nervous it was not going to be what I expected, and was trying to keep my expectations low. But my gosh, it’s so perfect, I almost cried. I’ve decided to give her “Gracie” clone to her for Christmas, because I simply can’t wait until spring. If it was up to my husband, he would’ve handed it to her the day it arrived, lol. I’ve shared my pics with all my co-workers & I’m guessing they’ll be ordering their own pet clones soon. To the artist that created our plush, THANK YOU for the priceless keepsake. I promise you’ve made one young lady, so very happy, and one momma grateful for the piece of home that she can take with her to college.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Customer,11/29/2023,"The best thing I ever did was getting this clone of my sweet Lola, every person that walks in my home thinks she’s real. Amazing job. Worth every penny.

And then I get to sleep with her and her ash’s are inside! ❤️❤️❤️❤️",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Crystal McGowan,11/27/2023,Let me just say I’m absolutely happy with this Company. I received my Daughters cuddle clone and as soon as I opened the bag all I saw was the brindle color and I instantly cried not even seeing her face yet. And let me tell you I cried even harder seeing all of her. Just absolutely Beautiful! I can’t wait to give her to my daughter Christmas day! I’m praying this will help give her closure. Thank you all so much! God Bless you all! Definitely will order from again and definitely recommend.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
erica burger baillif,11/24/2023,I love our Sam cuddle clone. It's a welcome to have her back in our lives after losing her to complications of cancer. The artist captured her face pattern perfectly.

François,11/24/2023,"A few days have passed since I received the plush and I love it. I couldn't live without it, I put my dog's hair in it and I can't stop cuddling him. I still miss my recently deceased dog enormously, but now I have a bit of him to cuddle.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tara Polson,11/20/2023,"This was our second Cuddle Clone and it was just as perfect as the first. We ordered this Cuddle Clone of sweet Bella, a Boxer whom we pulled from the shelter and were planning to foster (or keep?), but who collapsed and died on us just 27 hours after bringing her home. Our whole family was devastated, but especially our daughter, who never got to say goodbye. I knew this would help ease her pain, and now Bella sleeps with her every night, just like our other Cuddle Clone of Jade, who passed away four years ago on Thanksgiving. They are both absolutely priceless, especially when you're trying to fill the void after the loss of a beloved pet. ❤️ Thank you, Cuddle Clone team, for your attention to detail and the care you put into each project. I recommend Cuddle Clones to everyone I know and will for sure be ordering again!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I decided to get a cuddle clone of her, and I was gobsmacked by how accurate it was. They got the lightning bolt mark on her face perfect, and that loving smile... Sometimes I catch it out of the corner of my eye and think she's still here with me. And her little kitty brother thinks she's back with us too.

And I was absolutely taken back by how much it looks like him. So much so that it’s almost scary! Nothing but tears when I opened the package and pulled him out. Whoever the artist was I give them props. They got every detail that made him so special. Now I have something to hold and snuggle, something that I can cherish forever. Although it’s not better than my real Carlos, it’ll do just fine until I see him again. Thank you cuddle clones truly for this amazing piece of work.

It made it a lot easier on us. We haven't even got her ashes back yet. She is the perfect size, because I can dress our clone of Juliet with the clothes Juliet used to wear, which is a comfort in itself. You did a good job with her hair & the way it flows. Her ears, her tail are perfect in how long they are, which is exactly how Juliet wore her hair. Thank you very much.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cuddle Clones did such a good job at matching Pickles coloration, unique markings in her fur, and of course.... that face.

Kayla Dieterle,10/19/2023,"I’ve known about Cuddle Clones for awhile now but never considered getting one myself until now. I was on the look out for a husky stuffed animal and couldn’t find any I liked, so I decided to finally put my foot down and invest in a Cuddle Clone of my soul dog, Kodiak. Even if she’s still young, I figured now was the best time! The accuracy is insane. Especially in her facial markings. Thank you so much!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Lexi,10/17/2023,"I am so impressed and happy with the results of this cuddle clone of my childhood dog, Miley. The details are amazing, even down to the freckles on her face and paws. I sadly had to say goodbye to Miley this past August and it hurts not being able to hug her anymore, but this cuddle clone brings some sort of comfort and feeling of connection with her again. I am so glad I decided to purchase from cuddle clones and would highly recommend.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Joyce Geary,10/12/2023,"Several years ago, I ordered pajamas for my granddaughters from Cuddel Clones. They were a hit!! Now, my olderst granddaughter is away at college and missing her dog PJ. So I ordered the Cuddle clone. The organization was prompt and kept me up to date on the progress. The actual clone is so very realistic to the living PJ. I would, and have, recommend Cuddle Clones to others who love their pets.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Zanetta Yarbrough,10/11/2023,I was skeptical at first to attempt to get a clone made of our Zoey. We lost her suddenly in August and we were devastated. I’m so glad i took the chance and had one made. You did an amazing job and I’m very happy with her. Even my other dog Izzy thought it was her. My husband has gotten freaked out at least 3 times because it looks so real. Thank you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We greatly appreciated the attention to details from Cuddle Clones team and especially Marvin's patience with me on the phone trying to understand and capture all the little details to make this Plush Clones look so wonderful . Cuddle Clones team is surely the best.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Christina,10/03/2023,"I am completely blown away by the cuddle clone that we received! I got this for my best friend who has been in the hospital for weeks and won’t be home again for a long time. She misses her dog more than anything, and was so comforted by the cuddle clone. We paid extra for the fast shipping, and received our cuddle clone in about a week from ordering!! It is IDENTICAL to her dog. Everyone who walks into her hospital room thinks that she has a real dog sitting on her lap! THANK YOU CUDDLE CLONES!!!! Now I just need a cuddle clone of my best friend to give to her dog…",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Susana Carrillo-Auces,10/02/2023,Cuddle Clones got it right on the spot. My Chihuahua passed away September 1st 2023 of this year. We had her for going on 7 years.

Heather Javenes,10/02/2023,"I recently purchased a cuddle clone of my sweet Ella Bella after I laid her to rest on 8/30/23... she was my everything & I thought this would be a great gift to myself. I am more than satisfied how she came out. What a fantastic company to work with. They even reached out once production started to ask if I wanted a bow on the top of her head like some of the pictures I sent. They really did a fantastic job & I would highly recommend them to EVERYONE! Thank you Cuddle Clone team & artist for the making of my best friend, Ella Bella.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
LQ,10/01/2023,"We are very pleased with our plush cuddle clone. It's obvious time was taken in all the details. We lost our sweet Rebel a month ago.

KMR,09/27/2023,"My cuddle clone was a gift from my husband and I absolutely love it. They have done a fabulous job of the shape of the head and body (I LOVE the ears, mouth and chin), and the markings are pretty accurate too. If I were being picky I would say that the fur could’ve been thicker around his neck (my husband specifically requested this), but overall they have done a great job and I’m delighted with my boy’s ’mini me’.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Julia Williams,09/26/2023,Bestie had lost her first fur baby Farrah about 1 year ago. She came into her life right before her child was born. I got her a CC and gave it to her this evening.

Jeanne Peters,09/25/2023,"My husband and I were grieving terribly at the loss of our 15 year old Chuy. I held my breath as I was opening the box and could not believe my eyes! At first I just cried holding him, but now we find ourselves talking and hugging him constantly. When I walk in a room I forget, just for a minute, that’s that’s not him. We can’t thank you enough. For those who hesitate to purchase from Cuddle Clones,, DON’T! Best decision we ever made",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Allyson McDougall,09/25/2023,"Lesson learned, do not cheap out on things! Back in April or May I ordered a stuffed animal replica of Naomi that was not a cuddle clone. The first picture that was sent to me was incredibly creepy. The seller agreed to redo the position and make it look more like her, which was almost as creepy. With the anniversary of Naomi’s one year coming, I decided to order the cuddle clone. I had no advance picture of it. When it arrived, I cried happy tears because I feel like she is home again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chris,09/25/2023,I just received the clone of my mini Aussie Zoey She passed in June unexpectedly and I have been missing her so much. I would like to thank the artists that worked on my girl she looks just like my Zoey. These plushes are so lifelike and are well made. They really take the time to add the unique details of each pet and I received updates as she was being created. They even captured the black spot on the side of her nose. It was worth every penny. Also got the bobble head and that is almost more realistic than the clone. Thank you again cuddle clone ❤️,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Quinn,09/22/2023,Thank you so much for making my family our dog who pass away,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Customer,09/17/2023," My 13 year old tortie girl, Cooper, passed about a month ago and my amazing partner got this for me. My cat had been sick for a long time and I spent a lot of time taking care of her. We spent the weekend after she died picking out our favorite photos of her while reminiscing, and he submitted them. When we took her out of the package we were instantly impressed with how well they captured my cat’s essence. Tortoiseshells can have complex coat coloring with intricate patterns. The artist who made mine did a wonderful job of picking out the features that really make it look like Cooper, including ones I didn’t think to specifically ask for, like the dark orange stripes on her face and her striped tail. I’m really happy with how it came out. It looks so much like her. I opted for the pouch and her ashes are tucked inside. It’s much nicer to hug the cuddle clone than trying to hug a wooden urn. The house feels a little less empty, and I like when I see the cuddle clone. Most often I look at this and remember how cute she was, and all of our happy times in my home.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Katrina,09/17/2023,"I cannot say enough good things about my cuddle clone and my overall experience with this company. They made sure everything was exactly what I asked for and even emailed me for additional details which I appreciated. The fur length, pattern and texture are spot on. The only thing I wish I’d asked for (which is completely my bad) was for a smaller head and muzzle- my dog had a comically small head! Other than that my cuddle clone of my beloved Toast is absolutely perfect. Seeing him again in such likeness is such a heartwarming and emotional feeling. Thank you cuddle clones!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Donna Long,09/14/2023,"My sister and I got a Cuddle Clone for our family dog that passed away suddenly. My mom likes to prop it up in places she used sit and it’s scary how realistic the Cuddle Clone is! Like I jump every time I pass it, very realistic!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Brianna Puccino,09/13/2023,My cuddle clone was probably one of the the best things I have ever received. My dog passed away over a month ago and I was hesitant on this but I needed something to help me with the lose my cuddle clone was everything I wanted and more. It was scary how much it looked like my boy that it brought me to tears. It was worth every dollar I spend on it. And all I can say is if your thinking about buying it but it because you will not be disappointed! .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stacy Eldridge,09/12/2023,"I lost the love of my life, my cherished 13 year old Chihuahua named Chloe, in June of 2021. Shortly after I found out about Cuddle Clones and thought I wanted one right away but kept putting off making the decision for two reasons. The cost was a lot for my budget, especially if it didn’t end up looking like her. But when I mentioned it to friends and family they thought it would be too painful for me if it did lol! Some even thought it seemed like something “creepy” for me to want to purchase. But finally I decided to shut down the naysayers as this was my decision and my money…and for crying out loud it was a stuffed animal not taxidermy lol! Boy I am so glad I did! I tried not to have my expectations too high, so as not to be disappointed, but the artists and designers really did an amazing job bringing my baby Chloes personality into this project! They even got the markings on her side and top of her head to match! When I first opened the package it took my breath away and it still continues to do so daily when I catch it out of the corner of my eye. But it doesn’t make me sad like everyone was worried about. In my opinion it helps keep her spirit alive as I am reminded of her and it makes me smile every time I see it. Since I obviously can’t do a side-by-side of the real Chloe I have tried recreating a few of my favorite photos to show you what a great job they did. It was worth every penny and I am glad I added the pocket in which I keep her favorite toy tucked inside. Thank you Cuddle Clones!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Karlah Chavolla,09/11/2023,I purchased a clone of my cat son who passed away suddenly. It's been very hard adjusting to life without him so I ordered it to make it easier for myself. I was super nervous but when I received it I cried. They did such an amazing job and honestly exceeded my expectations. He looks just like my baby and I'm so happy to have a piece of him to hold at night. It gives me so much comfort to see him because he looks identical. When I had questions about my order Manuela was super helpful and very quick with her responses. I would definitely order from here again. Thank you for giving me my baby back.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therese Brosmer,09/08/2023,"Baby Girl was a stowaway traveling with her brother from the east coast to Colorado when they were kittens. She first chose my Fiance back when we were still friends. She was only the size of his palm. How could he resist? Through thick and thin Baby Girl was always there! From traveling to camping to hotels, she always seemed up for a new adventure! Our family and friends called her a forever kitten, because although she had a long just over 13 years with us. She wasn't very big. Larger than a kitten and smaller than other fully grown cats. We lost our beautiful girl to degenerative spine disease. Shortly after her passing I looked into Cuddle Clones here. The artist did a wonderful job! They got extremely close to our girl. This clone is twice the size Baby Girl was and the marks and ears are slightly different. Overall this clone is so close it reminds me of our girl and even confuses my eldest daughters cat Wittles. The artist did a wonderful job! Please thank them for us! The first photo is the clone and the second is our Baby Girl.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nancy Blackketter,09/07/2023,"Thank you Cuddle Clones for bringing our beautiful girls back to us. They were both extraordinarily beautiful Miniature Schnauzers, Carys was truly spectacular with a very soft coat that shone like polished silver in the sunlight. She crossed the Rainbow Bridge in 2018 and we still grieve her loss today. Trudy was a very tiny Mini Schnauzer with a glorious \midnight silver\""",very soft blackish coat with silver highlights that glistened in the sunlight as well. Unhappily she too crossed the Rainbow Bridge just this past June. They both lived nearly 15 years,and we are still devastated by their passing - they brought so much love and joy to our lives! We miss them both terribly! We ordered Cuddle Clones of both of our girls,and they are so beautiful! We knew Trudy would be difficult to reproduce because of her coloring - so dark,and because of her very tiny size for a Mini Schnauzer. We submitted Trudy's actual dimensions along with the photos,and Cuddle Clones did a remarkable job reproducing Trudy exactly to size! It is so wonderful having both our girls back with us! It's almost like having them with us now,"forever. Thank you Cuddle Clones for helping to ease our pain of loosing our beautiful girls.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Marie Clark,08/29/2023,"My dear departed Buddy crossed the rainbow bridge on 1-2-2013. He was 16 and I’d adopted him from a shelter at age 12-16 weeks old. He was the first dog I’d ever owned as an adult. We went through so much together! Boyfriends, a travel nursing career, so many moves to different apartments and houses, adjusting to other dogs that I adopted, marriage. I loved that dog so much, it hurt. I’ve wanted a Cuddle Clone for so many years… I think I wanted one when he was still alive but could not justify the price. I am glad I decided to get one. From his long ear whispies, his little bushy eyebrows and fuzzy grinch feet (could be a little grinchier like his actually were but ya’ll did try) to his bushy bi-color fan tail… Cuddle Clones knocked this one out of the park. And I’m also impressed with the nose detail as Buddy had just a hint of lighter color running down the middle of his nose and that was captured as well!!! Impressive. Truly. Thank y’all from the bottom of my heart. I put his old collar on him immediately and it’s almost like he’s home again. Very special.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They made her look like her younger self and it’s so spot on with the color of the stuffed animals eyes it matched cocos perfectly. Cuddle clone I truly appreciate all you did on my coco and the time you took to get her key features right!

Emily,08/25/2023," I am blown away by the Cuddle Clone of my sweet Bosco. He passed away on August 12th and I didn’t feel like could survive without him. I ordered his cuddle clone a few days after he passed, hoping it would bring me some relief having something that reminded me of him that I could hold. I did a rush order and it came even earlier than I expected. Ordering it gave me something to look forward to and when it arrived today, it took my breath away. It looks exactly like my sweet Bosco. It has all of his markings and even the tear marks he always had. It’s so realistic, it is startling, in a good way. Every aspect is perfect to the last detail. Such an amazing way to honor my boy and bring some relief to my pain. Thank you cuddle clones.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Marie,08/25/2023,Last Sunday I received my order from cuddle clones. The day after Shelbi died I was so lost. It was like a piece of me died. I've had her almost 16 years. I went to sit down on the couch like I always did. She wasn't there waiting like always. I even made a pillow I folded to lay my arm on.. As I sat there crying I started looking up stuffed animals. I came upon this site called cuddle clones. Where they make a clone of your animals any kind. So I took a risk spent almost $300 on the chance it would look like her. Sent pictures side shots this and that. Took a month and she came home. I know it's not her. And to each it's own. But I wanted this. And she turned out amazing. Thank you so much. Absolutely beautiful,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My mind immediately said I needed two things, a weighted blanket and a cuddle clone. I waited, a little excited and a little nervous, and when she finally came I broke down into tears, it was my Sapphire again. This company is amazing and I whole heartedly recommend them as they do fantastic work. Thank you, cuddle clone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A few details aren't quite spot-on (how much fur around his neck, the white between his eyes and along his snout), but apart from those, he is perfect to me. Especially his unique and beautiful bunny teeth! I am so happy I took the gamble and ordered a Cuddle Clone. My Napoleon passed away last year at 16 years and 8 months old. I know nothing can ever truly measure up to him, but having this Cuddle Clone of him makes me so unbelievably happy. He also arrived weeks earlier than expected!

mio,08/20/2023,"We got a plushie made of our cat who just recently passed away. The face isn't very accurate, but the rest of the body is pretty good. We showed the plush to our other cat, she was kind of scared and first and thought it was a real cat! It didn't take very long for her to warm up to it. I think it has actually helped her get some closure about what happened to her sister, she spends a lot of time laying around it and even sleeps next to it sometimes. I'd say it was definitely worth it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

shannon squires,08/07/2023,"I was hesitant on getting one of my dog Daisy that I had for 17 years because she was the definition of a mutt and I haven't seen many dogs that look like her (even multiple vets couldnt guess what all breeds she was but I decided to do it and worse case send it back. I'm so glad I did. The coloring and pattern is spot on. It looks sooooo much like my girl. The face is a little off but it's because the stuffed animals face is a little bigger than my girls was but once again she was a mix breed so I'm not surprised it wasn't perfect. When you look at it there's no question that it's supposed to be my baby girl. When I first got it I had mix feeling JUST because seeing her in my home again was bitter sweet. Now that I've adjusted to it and my brain has accepted that it's not her everytime i take a glance at it, it has helped tremendously with my loss. Im only saying that not to discourage anyone but because I didnt think about it possible hurting seeing her again and my brain just forgetting for a second that she was gone. However I do not regret it and I am use to it now. I chose to add the pouch with the zipper so I could put her ashes in it and couldn't have picked a better forever resting spot for my best friend. I say go ahead and get one. Worse case if it's not to your liking they offer full refunds within a time frame. We are now saving up to be able to get one for my sons cat that passed away.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Courtney,08/03/2023,"After losing my dog of 16 years, I was looking for some comfort and something to help me and my family through the loss. I have to admit I was worried because my dog is a mixed breed with very complex markings. But whoever made my cuddle. Clone has clearly taking so much time and care and put so much effort into getting it right which I appreciate so much. One of my family members actually thought weed had the dog taxidermied LOL. It looks so much like him it’s unreal and from the corner of your eye you would think it was him. Thank you so much cuddle clones I would 100% recommend and it’s worth the money..",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sherry,08/02/2023,"We were very impressed with the clone of Baku. They did a very good job on making him. He looks identical to the real Baku. Everyone that has saw the clone is in awe of the exact likeness. So yes, we are beyond grateful for our cloned Baku. Thank you so much team for all the hard work you put into duplicating our Baku.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ginny King aka Virginia King,08/01/2023,Cuddle clone produced a beautiful duplicate of our 15 yr old pup. He was the best sweet and funny dog and was a joy to travel with.

I would highly recommend this company, not just for the likeness of our pet, but for the excellent customer service from start to finish.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Katie J,07/28/2023,"First off, my cuddle clone was a memorial for my Piggy cat who passed in January. The CC is so cute, and they did a great job with the directions I left — down to the kinks in her tail! I asked for short but plushy fur, and that’s exactly what I got. I’m really impressed with the attention to detail. My only complaint is the size. It’s HUGE. My biggest cat is 12 pounds and the CC is as big as her! Piggy was a very petite cat - 5 lbs. If there’s any constructive feedback id offer, it would be to offer sizing options. Otherwise, I’m very happy with how it turned out. :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rachel,07/28/2023,"Kevin passed 4/23/23 overall the family is very happy with this clone. However I am a little disappointed with a couple things. Kevin was perfectly imperfect and that's why I turned to Cuddle Clones. He had a missing paw pad on his back left foot and the other back foot had a black pad where the missing one was. I specified this in the notes but didn't realize that the logo would be on the left foot, the right is perfect. I guess that might be on me for not seeing it in pictures. I mainly saw the craftsmanship and during the mourning of him and thought it would be a great way to remember him, and for the most part it is. His tail is beautiful and I love the way they even got the way he sat right. However another thing I wish was a little different was that Kevin was a VERY fluffy guy, you could barely see his collar but no matter how much I fluffed the Clone I couldn't get him as fluffy as I wanted around the head and neck area even after brushing and using a cool hairdryer on him. I am unsure of the details of behind the scenes and I understand that some things are out of the manufacturers controle such as hair length, and placement, like how high the longer hair goes on the head. The last thing that I wish was a little different was the ear size to head ratio. Kevin had pretty large ears and the ones on the clone feel so small for a pup. Other than those things he is amazing, so much so at a glace we think he's our other dog. We have a little pup about the same size as Kevin Clone and we all keep thinking he's on the table. (Not really part of the review but because they are in the pictures, the white dog is Santa 4/22/23, our golden boy is Bernie. Samson is the little baby that we keep thinking is on the table, we have to get used to seeing them both in the same room haha.) Thank you Cuddle Clones for the effort, the sewing is beautiful, he is definitely as sturdy as the real Kevin was. I apologize if this comes off way too critical but his death was so heart breaking because he was so young and the first dog that I can remember that did not pass of natural causes. I still like the Clone overall and the people that Emailed me during the process were amazing. Nothing could ever replace Kevin the way he was, but I am greatful to the team and people that gave us something to remember him by.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Vickie Day,07/27/2023,"All his life, my little Mouse was a professional sleeper. And I was lucky enough to have him snuggling with me under the bed covers every single night for the last 15 years. I love that sweet boy so much and I knew a long time ago that I would never be the same and never able to sleep without him. Now I have to. Mouse left me this past April at the age of 17. I was desperate to find a stuffed animal that looked like Mouse that I could sleep with and one of the first Google search results that came up was Cuddle Clones. I couldn't believe such a company existed. But so grateful. I placed an order and ended up requesting a remake and I am so very, very happy with the result. The artist(s) did an amazing job and the customer service was top notch. Thanks to Cuddle Clones, I can sleep again, snuggling with my Mouse Clone. Thank you, Cuddle Clones, for giving me my little Mouse back. (I just wish I could really have him back again.)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jennifer Flanz,07/27/2023," Our dog Emmi sadly passed away at only 7 years old. A couple days after that, my sister and I ordered a cuddle clone of her for our mother. We couldn't provide every picture they needed to create this version of her, but they did an amazing job. When it arrived and we unboxed it, we instantly got tears in our eyes. Our mother was speechless and started crying when she saw her. I would rate this company with a million stars if it was possible. I will definitely recommend it! Even the support team was extremly nice and helpful and responded very fast. Thank you so much for everything.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

His appearance was one of a kind . he was a Golden Retriever and German Shepherd mix. Pictures never did him justice, so I was worried how he would turn out. Granted he’s not exact, but I can see all the love and detail in his clone and they did an exceptional job recreating his likeness. He’s not super soft but he is excellent quantity and he’s not going to fall apart anytime soon.. I just love him!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Let me just say that this looks so much like my dog to the point where it scares me when I walk in the room and think it's her. I was skeptical that it would be good at first, yorkies are probably hard to make. But they got it perfect. Down to her fur, her look, her colors, her face, body, and even her cataract. I want to hug the artist who took the time to sculpt this exactly as my baby who is no longer here. 100% recommended. Let me add that they also messaged me asking if I would like to add the cataract. great service",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Jonathan Glass,07/22/2023," We adopted LC, a beautiful shorthair with genetically not even a stub of a tail, when he was almost 10. His original owner had become a K9 handler and her working dog twice tried to kill LC and mauled him badly the second time so they needed to rehome him. LC immediately adopted us and gave his love freely. We knew he had health issues, both from age and being patched up from being torn open, but he was healthy and happy for a year. He loved to cuddle and be around us, and would often express his love in his own unique way, with violent purring headbutts lol. Then he started loosing weight and the vet gave us the bad news, there was nothing more they could do but try to keep him comfortable. We were devastated as he slowly wasted away and became weak and frail, but we kept putting off having him put to sleep because as sick as he was. We thought we’d know when it was time because he wouldn’t want that interaction anymore. I knew by then that I wanted a cuddle clone after he passed, so I took pictures all around him to prepare. As it happened, LC loved on us till his last day. My wife noticed he was panting and not leaving his usual spot on the bed, so she picked him up and called me at work. Then LC passed away in her arms while I was on the phone. It was like he hung on until she made him feel safe and loved, and then he let himself go. Although I worry that we let him suffer longer than we should have, I take comfort that he still had purrs and love right up until the very end, he was just such a good cat, and we are incredibly grateful for the year of love he gave us. I ordered cuddle clone LC the day after he passed. It took almost the whole 8 weeks, but the results were worth it. I was a little apprehensive because the cats don’t always seem to get the most reviews, but you just have provide lots of pictures and set reasonable expectations. The cat faces are not lifelike, they’re like stuffed animal toys with slightly wonky proportions. But I knew that and preferred something toyish so it wouldn’t be creepy. They absolutely nailed LC’s fur patterns and coloring, and I appreciated that they made him sitting like a sphinx which was my only special request. My wife held him and bawled her eyes out. I did too. Even though he was only with us for a year we loved LC so much and now although he is gone we have a representation of him to hold and love. Thanks so much for providing a service like this! To anyone else thinking about a remembrance of a cat, take pictures all around them before they are gone, and from odd angles with good lighting. It will help them get the fur right. And know that the cats are like regular toyish stuffed animals with your pet’s features, not lifelike representations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I got regular e-mails with status updates as well. I was absolutely thrilled to get it. It looks so real, my other two cats thought I brought home a new cat! It also has the cat's name on the tag for a customized feel. This is something I will keep for the rest of my life. Needless to say, I am absolutely ecstatic.

Kyu,07/13/2023,"I was very excited and at the same time nervous to see the results. I had high hopes by watching the good reviews and because they asked me some questions to get better at accuracy. I think they did a really good job to be honest! I send a ton of photos and they paid good attention to all of them, specially the details in the shape and fur of the tail and the chest. We are all very amazed by the results. We feel she is here. Xakti (her sister) sometimes approaches with curiosity, kisses the plush and wants to play ♥. Luna had brain cancer that developed in 6 months, she passed away on May 31st, it has been a one of the toughest process in my life.

M. Kelly,07/11/2023,"I was very happily surprised by the amazingly close likeness to my Augie-dog, a mostly English Springer Spaniel. Because my dog passed away many years ago (decades), I was unable to provide Cuddle Clone artists the comprehensive body photos they need to insure a good match. Therefore, I provided several photos I found on Pinterest and other online sites that were close matches to Augie. The customer service was a pleasure to work with and they showed no reluctance to work from very limited input. In the end, the final result is fantastic and the artistry really shows. A Springer Spaniel has a variety of spots on its entire body, different sizes, shapes, shades of black, so it’s incredible that the likeness is so true. Many thanks, Cuddle Clones.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Layla,06/27/2023,"My 14yr old cat, Cleopatra passed away and I've missed her so much. I was nervous about this purchase but am so happy with my custom cuddle clone! More than once other people and I have been startled walking into the room, thinking it were a real cat. At certain angles or out the corner of my eye, for a moment I think it's her. I obsessed a little over her coloring, which has changed a lot throughout her life. I wish I had been more specific on her fur length. It asks if the animal has short or long hair. I said short but Cleo was somewhere in between. I didn't make a note of that and it's difficult to tell in the photos. I really appreciate that this is handmade and one-of-a-kind, like my precious girl so I don't want them to redo it. They captured her likeness and pose! As a crafter, I'm impressed by the quality of sewing and airbrushing. They even added a zippered pouch for her ashes! Thank you!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Connie Smith,06/24/2023,"My husband and I had to say goodbye to our sweet, beloved kitty cat Misty May last month.. We’d adopted her 15 years ago from the Humane Society and over the last 18 months her health continued to decline. She’s been such a wonderful companion over the years through personal health challenges and death of my mom 13 months ago. She is greatly missed. The Cuddle Clone artists did a good job replicating her markings ,paying attention to special requests I’d made of unique patterns on her chest, tail and belly. The color is darker in areas and the clone is larger than Misty was in real life, particularly the head. It is somewhat stiff..,.wish it was more “squishable “ Overall I’m satisfied with the representation and the workmanship is very good. Customer service is great and I received it sooner than the scheduled eight weeks . There are times when looking out of the corner of my eye or entering the room ,it takes me aback, thinking it’s my girl in the flesh. Of course, nothing can replace your real fur kid,but having her Clone is a comfort.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

JOHN FITZGERALD,06/09/2023,Ozzy was the most handsome dog in the world taken too soon. He had a thyroid condition for years and it made him eventually lose a lot of his hair when he got older.

Connie Smith,06/05/2023,"My husband and I had to say goodbye to our sweet, beloved kitty cat Misty May last month.. We’d adopted her 15 years ago from the Humane Society and over the last 18 months her health continued to decline. She’s been such a wonderful companion over the years through personal health challenges and death of my mom 13 months ago. She is greatly missed. The Cuddle Clone artists did a good job replicating her markings ,paying attention to special requests I’d made of unique patterns on her chest, tail and belly. The color is darker in areas and the clone is larger than Misty was in real life, particularly the head. It is somewhat stiff..,.wish it was more “squishable “ Overall I’m satisfied with the representation and the workmanship is very good. Customer service is great and I received it sooner than the scheduled eight weeks . There are times when looking out of the corner of my eye or entering the room ,it takes me aback, thinking it’s my girl in the flesh. Of course, nothing can replace your real fur kid,but having her Clone is a comfort.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Willie was constantly the center of my attention and losing him was a devastating lose for my family and I. Although I had his ashes and hundreds of pictures, I still longed to see a physical version of him again. After a lot of thought, I decided to just purchase a cuddle clone and pay the hefty price tag. I finally received the plush today and the attention to detail was just insane.

Renata McRee,05/25/2023,"Wow! Cuddle clones did it this time! I’m a returning customer and I’m glad I returned. My first order was hard because I didn’t have much photos. This time I did an alive cat and so I was able to get photos of the cat easily! First of all why I got lokidew. He’s such a cute cat and I love him and bonded with him as a baby. His brother is Thor and funny enough they are both like their names. Mishevuous loki tricked me into thinking he had no teeth so I fed him with a spoon wet slurry and I have loved him ever since! But Loki is getting older in years and I am so worried about what will happen when he passes away . I’ll miss him so much! I’m glad I got a cuddle clone now because I was able to just go up to him and take all the photos Cuddle needed. Cuddle clones definitely works well from lots of photos cause the result is amazing this time! The replicated my cats fur color, marking and head and got his little nose freckle like I requested. Also got his furry toes and omg they did the most beautiful eyes which are a bluefish aqua color with a touch of grey and green just like my baby Lokis eyes, they really are hard to describe but they got it! An amazingly to my absolute happiness and joy they got Lokdews curly tummy hairs which are just the cutest thing and make him him! So really really glad they included that and were able to do it as requested! I was worried they couldn’t replicate them but they did! It looks exactly like Loki baby’s tummy fur! I’m soo pleased! And wants even cooler is Loki (the real Loki lol ) is on the smaller side and this plushie clone is exactly the same size as him. I haven’t gotten Loki to sit still yet but I can’t wait for him and cuddle clones Loki to meet hehehe .",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Megan,05/13/2023,"I had very low expectations for this product, despite the price. I lost my Dash only three weeks ago and ordered this two weeks ago, and got the 4 week rush shipping. It got here in less than two weeks, which is incredible. I figured I’d open the package and it would just be an eh stuffed animal. I opened the package, looked down and saw only his lower half belly and paws and lost it. I am so overwhelmed, in a good way. He looks nearly identical to my pup. They even somehow got his fur to lay right. I’m just shocked. Is he identical to my pup? No, his face isn’t exactly the same and his body size proportions are slightly off (his body was a lot longer), but I didn’t expect him to be 100% or expect him to be a replacement for Dash. It’s unrealistic to expect it to be spot on, and this is more of just a comfort product for me. This is beyond my expectations, and it brings me a lot of peace. I’m very happy with my cuddle clone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lisa,05/09/2023,"Cuddle Clones really brought Bogart back to life! I honestly admit that I did not expect this to be as good as it is. I had assumed I would need to send it back for a redo. Bogart was a mixed breed dog with very specific features and lots of gradient in color. The clone is not 100% perfect (the ears should be wider, the snout thinner, his feet a little less white) but all of my \complaints:\"" are minor enough that I do not feel a redo necessary. And the slight \""off\""-ness helps it not be TOO real and uncanny. But I am honestly outrageously impressed and how well they were able to capture his coloring",his shape,"even his curly tail!

Tiki just crossed the Rainbow Bridge April 23, 2023. I am so glad I did this. My boy was my kindred spirit for sure. I have had many many in my life, He was extra special. Tiki went through some awful trauma prior to adopting him in 2007 where we think his nose was bound shut causing a permanent scar. Cuddle Clones was able to add that pretty well. The plush is a comfort, and adds a little love and smiles to our family in this tough time. Thank you Cuddle Clones.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Also I wasn’t expecting it to arrive for another month and it surprisingly showed up yesterday. 5 stars, this is worth every penny, I promise you!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Megan,04/29/2023,"I had very low expectations for this product, despite the price. I lost my Dash only three weeks ago and ordered this two weeks ago, and got the 4 week rush shipping. It got here in less than two weeks, which is incredible. I figured I’d open the package and it would just be an eh stuffed animal. I opened the package, looked down and saw only his lower half belly and paws and lost it. I am so overwhelmed, in a good way. He looks nearly identical to my pup. They even somehow got his fur to lay right. I’m just shocked. Is he identical to my pup? No, his face isn’t exactly the same and his body size proportions are slightly off (his body was a lot longer), but I didn’t expect him to be 100% or expect him to be a replacement for Dash. It’s unrealistic to expect it to be spot on, and this is more of just a comfort product for me. This is beyond my expectations, and it brings me a lot of peace. I’m very happy with my cuddle clone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Danette,04/29/2023,I am so amazed at how perfect they were able to make our Patches so lifelike. Very emotional when I first opened the bag. Thank you so much for making our whole family so grateful. Attached is a side by side of him and the cuddle clone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Losing him and being so far away broke my heart. My husband got me a Cuddle Clone of him and I absolutely love it. It looks exactly like him and is the perfect size too. Its scary good and I would recommend this to anyone who needs one more cuddle. When my husband's good boy leaves, I will be back.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Jennifer Breed,04/28/2023,"Jingle Bells ... my baby and shadow 16 yrs... feel lost with out her. There's pain where she'd lay on my chest or legs.. like missing a limb. I sent in pictures and the stuffy arrived yesterday (took only 4 weeks). After some time looking at it and holding it.... I like the solid size & weight ..perfect to hug/lean on. I fluffed the ears, and with my fingernails I pushed up at the glue outlining the shiny eyeball buttons (they needed to be just a tiny bit bigger and brighter, it still felt sticky and not fully dry -so it worked, now it's good lol). Seeing the collar fit and putting a small vile of ashes in the zipper pocket ... I do feel better... just being near it.. I couldn't hug/kiss her ashes before.. and her favorite place to be was on my bed ..it does help. It's not an exact copy lol.. her \plushy form\""- but it does look like her..the goofy ears/ all the spots/ neck wrinkles .. .. lol the little details make me smile .. so.. it's the best stuffed animal ever to me 💕""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Lauraleigh Devey,04/28/2023,"Loosing my “Possum”, was far beyond shattering. She was the best “best friend”, the perfect companion. Always by my side after camp Chemo. So now I have the next best thing, my “Possum” cuddles to comfort me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Maria,04/28/2023,I was amazed to open my Cuddle Clone and such a replica of my girl . I find comfort of seeing her ! Thanks Cuddle Clones,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Lisa,04/28/2023,"Cuddle Clones really brought Bogart back to life! I honestly admit that I did not expect this to be as good as it is. I had assumed I would need to send it back for a redo. Bogart was a mixed breed dog with very specific features and lots of gradient in color. The clone is not 100% perfect (the ears should be wider, the snout thinner, his feet a little less white) but all of my \complaints:\"" are minor enough that I do not feel a redo necessary. And the slight \""off\""-ness helps it not be TOO real and uncanny. But I am honestly outrageously impressed and how well they were able to capture his coloring",his shape,"even his curly tail! I truly am blown away and thrilled with my product. Thank you so much!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
marnie brockamp,04/27/2023,The Cuddle Clone team really captured the look and personality of our dog. We are so pleased and highly recommend!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Renata McRee,04/27/2023,"What wasn’t quite right: they almost got thought to be fair a brown black cat is hard. Though I did say when they asked for detail that my cat had brown coloring throughout his body and in the clone I’m just not seeing it. When they asked for more photos I submitted more showing the sides of my kitty which has brown black coloring and they asked if the brown coloring was just on his chest but I replied it eas in his whole body. When I got plushie it just looks black? Also, I submitted a photo of my kittys chest and he has several white hairs and they didn’t put that on the cuddle clone plushie. What was right: they did get my cats big furry paws and the texture of the fur is correct. I am quite pleased with that. Also his stubby manx “rabbit” tail is quite on point. Overall I give this one a nearly but not for 100 percent but then I was T really expecting 100% so I’m still pretty pleased. 4 stars though cause even though I emotions the brown coloring several times im I’m not seeing it and I’m also puzzled why they didn’t do the white spot on his chest even though it’s in the photo.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Now that I got Cara’s the tan one I might order another one of Peta and send pictures before he passed as she was a lot thinner. I would recommend to friends and family….make sure you communicate with the artist and let them know what you want them to focus on so they can get it as close to what you are looking for as they are just going off pictures and don’t know what your favorite part of your dog…or cat was.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After some time of her getting progressively worse, we took her to another vet to get another answer and turned out it was a tumour that couldn’t be fixed. She was a year and 2 months old and put down on her gotcha day. She was such an amazing cat and to be able to get a plush that looks exactly like her down to her paw pads being different colours. It has helped me heal from her passing and keeps my memories of her alive.

The team were so amazing about reaching out to ask questions to be as exact as possible to the real life Duke they were creating. When I told them he was for my boyfriend and that he had passed they had so much compassion and kindness and wanted to even more make this amazing. The item came and I loved it, looked so close to the picture I sent and I knew my boyfriend was going to love it. I gave it to him for his birthday and he teared up. We are so excited to take Duke golfing with us this summer and for future! Thank you so much CUDDLE CLONES!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They listened to every note I left, they got her facial expression on point, her eye colors exactly right, and even got her little hairs in the back sticking up just like she has. I am satisfied. I had a wonderful experience ordering from here. Thank you cuddle clones.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Customer,03/19/2023,"My Tinklebell passed away in my arms 3 years ago. She was my girl. She was a rescue and I had her for only 4 years, she stole my heart. Thanks to who ever bought and sent me this Cuddle Clone of my Tink. It made my heart happy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Natalie Rippin,03/16/2023," My dog was my best friend for 17 years. He passed away January 30th. I've never been so sad. This cuddle clone looks so much like him, it's like he's risen from the dead. I will say his legs are shorter and his fir is more rough. The fur is also stained so it'll smell funky for a little bit, but the smell goes away. It's more stuff than a stuffed animal, which I think is great because it gives a more life-like appearance. It's worth the money. It's the only thing I have to cope with his loss. They even added a tag that says, \Rocky.\"" They took such care and detail. With that said",the time it takes for shipping is pretty bad,but I wanted them to take their time,so I'm not upset about it. Don't worry with tracking. It doesn't show up when you try to track it,I'm not sure why. I reached out to their team,"and they were very helpful. I highly recommend getting a cuddle clone. It changed my life. It makes living without my best friend bearable. Thank you Cuddle Clone Team for making my buddy and best friend Rocky. I'll cherish this forever.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Julianne Barrow,03/16/2023,Blondi finally has her handsome prince Bo. Another wonderful purchase from cuddle clones. They will be spending the rest of their lives here in their forever home. My gorgeous Bo Bo Boy passed away in 2008 to cancer and I was completely devastated. In remembrance of him I paired him with the famous Blondi from WWII in my writings as mates. Thank you Thank you so much! This has been a dream come true for me as a writer. Bo and Blondi will forever live on in The Germanians series and always in my heart! Thank you!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Customer,03/16/2023,"My perfect Australian Shepherd Mugsy was taken from us by Lymphoma. I ordered myself a cuddle clone because he was so stunning, unique and his name sake was my plush toy the TY Mugsy Aussie. I can’t believe how strikingly like Mugsy the clone looks, it can be a little shocking to walk into a room and see it. Luckily it’s slightly smaller and the face shape is just different enough that my mind can’t play too cruel a trick. The artist deserves major appreciation because they got every single detail and some I didn’t elaborate on, down to a weird patch of curly hair in his leg. They mimicked his ridiculous puppy sit, and adorable ears and markings better than I could have dreamt. I can’t get over all the right details and it does feel like this plush clone perfectly holds my memory of him. I got to have the best dog in the world for 7 years, but this plushie memory will be cherished for the rest of my life.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
M.G.,03/15/2023,"I lost my sweet wheaten terrier Jack suddenly in January, it was a devastating loss. The next day I ordered a cuddle clone and receding it brought me a great deal of comfort.

James Mustard,03/15/2023,"I lost my baby on March 20, 2022. Ever since I lost her, I have been a wreck. Everyone kept telling me to get another baby, but I could never bring myself to do it. I felt like I would be cheating on her. Yoko, my baby, was the only child and loved it that way. One of friends sent me a text with information about Cuddle Clones. I was over the moon. And now that I have Yoko back in my bed, thanks to Cuddle Clones, I feel alive again. Thank you....thank you....thank you. Did I mention....thank you?!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Elizabeth Wojcik,03/15/2023,I received our Cuddle clone yesterday and I gotta say we are very impressed with how she turned out. Five stars plus for sure and I will highly recommend to my friends,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Customer,03/14/2023,You created a clone of our departed Siamese Magda. My husband rarely cries but Magda was special to him. When he opened the box he got very emotional and then I started crying. Thank you. You even got my last minute note about making her look like she is judging you 🤣. Nailed it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Kim Fortune,03/14/2023,"The ckone was so resl looking! I took him to work to show a few friends and my one friend had a look of horror thinking Harvey passed and I had him taxidermied. Thats how much he looks like the real thing. Such craftsmanship, this company knows what they're doing! Here photos of real Harvey and clone Harvey. His double coat hair was challenging I am sure!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
T Vonbergen,03/14/2023,This experience of losing a pet is so heartbreaking… but now having a cuddle clone it makes having my little girl back home easier for all in the house… I have another little dog an as soon as we opened up an got our cuddle clone out of the package his tail was back to wagging again!! You will not be disappointed in the item… mine looks identical to my dog!!

Carley Hubbard,03/12/2023,"I literally have no words. I have been in so much pain after losing my Lhasa Apso of 16 1/2 years, Gabby, in December 2022. I Immediately knew that I needed something to help me get through this (mind you I have been battling constant vertigo since Gabby passed). Long story short, I sent in all these photos and checked in because I was so excited and they would ask me the most specific questions like “I need the side view of her body and face” even after i sent so many photos just so they would get the sizing perfect. I cried for hours when I received my Gabby because this company simple CARES. I even bugged them and bugged them bc I was so heartbroken and all they wanted to do was make sure they had everything the needed to make her perfect. I have already told multiple people about this amazing, sympathetic, detail oriented company and will continue to everytime I hear someone in need. I cannot really explain in words what they did for me. Please see below and in all honesty I think my Gabby should be on the front page. Spectacular customer service and artistry. Cuddle Clones helped my heart heal and as an artist, their attention to detail is undeniably the very best. THANK YOU CC! Y’all have my love and support forever!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Scott Ventrice,03/11/2023,"My wife suffered a spinal cord injury that has paralyzed her, and has been in ICU for 2 months. One of the things she misses most is her dog Jagger.

Amanda,03/11/2023,We lost our pomapoo Max last year. It was very sudden. Max was older than my kids so they have never lived without him. My daughter only wanted a replica of Max for her birthday. It came today and it is absolutely perfect! The tail sits up on his back like Maxy. His fur is like Maxy. It's so much alike that I sent a picture to my mother and she thought it was an old picture of Max! I think my daughter's face says it all! Thank you so much Cuddle Clones for making an almost 12 year old extremely happy! ♥️,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Meredith Holtz,03/11/2023,"Cuddle Clones was able to make a perfect copy of our Sneakers! I’ve ordered clones of 5 of our cats, and this is the best one yet. (One was a total fail, but 4 out of 5 isn’t bad). Very pleased with this one.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Kendall,03/08/2023,I got a cuddle clone after my dog passed away. For me this is the closest I can get to holding my dog again. It is the comfort I need when I miss him too much for words 💔. It is a great likeness and that is saying something for an all American mutt. Highly recommend to anyone who needs a way to hold their fur baby when holding the real one is not an option.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Megan,03/06/2023,"Commissioned a look alike of my dog Coco, a Faux-Co if you will. She seems a little freaked out by it but we all love it, it's adorable, has so many little spot on details, and is a great conversation piece. The shop would email us throughout with updates about the project which was very nice.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Customer,03/04/2023," Our beloved Stewie passed away 3 years ago and I am still greaiving his loss. I have had many pets in my long life but Stewie was different, he was intuitive to my medical issues and my needs. Stewie came to live with us when my mother in-law went into Hospice. From the very beginning we were inseparable until he passed. When I saw the post on Facebook about Cuddle Clones I was intrigued so I looked at the reviews and I knew I wanted one of Stewie. Today when I opened the package we were all just couldn't believe how perfectly his likeness is to Stewie. After I put one of Stewie's sweater on him our dog Annie that was his companion sniffed it and gave him kisses. I am so happy that I paid for the artistry of the creators.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Abbey,03/04/2023,Our Cuddle Clone of our sweet Chloe arrived. Looks just like her! We have been missing her with her recent passing. Our boys just love her ❤️,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Michael D.,03/04/2023,"Seeing ads for these for months and finally took the plunge when we found out Snowball was palliative. Ordered two days before kidney disease finally took her - at age 20. She was vital and active right up to the last day, and we were happy to prioritize her for the last weeks of her life, spending much time with her and ensuring she was comfortable. No chance to photograph her with the clone, which I think is only right. Snowball was a very unique personality and will never be replaced. I was very happy nonetheless to received the cuddleclone today. I was not expecting perfection but also not expecting it to be as good as it is. The real Snowball was a little bit smaller than our clone, and I knew it would probably be that way, but the team astonished us with a great job matching the colours of her coat. I was convinced the hair on her back would be way off as it never did photograph well and you couldn't tell how subtle the tan streaks on her back were. I worried for nothing as the team managed to replicate her coat perfectly. Definitely some mixed feelings in the household about this - uncanny valley kind of hits you at first - but I feel comforted somehow to know that not only do we have her remains here in the house with us, but this cuddleclone reminds us very much of what she looked like in life, and all the joy she brought to us. Only negative comment will be the packaging. It came in a bag, not a box. There was a tag attached advising that her ears and coat might have to be primped a bit, and the explanation was given that by not using boxes, 'x' number of trees were saved. I don't feel that is appropriate. My country's economy includes a large forestry sector that employs thousands of people, and to state the obvious - trees grow back. A premium product like this deserves a sturdier shipping container, I hope you will consider this in future. The family enjoys this product so far, so much so that there was talk of ordering additional cuddleclones. I'd like to see at the least an option for a cardboard shipping container, even if it was for an extra fee. Take the money and donate it to your favourite carbon offset charity. Otherwise, thrilled to have this in the house, and thank you to your team of artists for capturing this important part of our household and lives.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Abigail Mulholland,02/24/2023,I really do love Cuddle Clones ! The amount of effort put in to any cuddle clone is enough to make you cry happy tears when you get to see them when they’re delivered to your house! I got one for my Chewy a year or two ago and I love it now I got one for my brothers dog and I have the slightest feeling I know that he is going to love it it looks so much like his dog that just recently passed Poochie!💜,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
c.,02/24/2023,"I lost my girl Ashlee on 4.3.21, she was 12 years old and I miss her tremendously. I saw Cuddle Clones ads on Instagram around the time she died and started to follow but I was never sure about getting one since I didn't know if it would truly look like Ashlee. When she arrived after Christmas, I was brought to tears at just how much it looks like her, right down to her one shorter ear (she suffered an injury that resulted in part of her ear being gone) and her signature pose with her paws crossed. Even her doggie brother Jasper was convinced it was really her...he kept sniffing and trying to cuddle up to the stuffie version of Ashlee. For anyone looking for a truly beautiful tribute to a beloved furbaby, I highly recommend getting a Cuddle Clone, the attention to detail is truly amazing!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Kelsey O.,02/23/2023," The ordering process was very smooth and easy to follow. Uploading pictures and descriptions was very easy; they were also VERY detailed in what they asked to ensure that they captured my pet's' look precisely. The detais that were crafted into the plushy were fantastic 😍!! They got his black 🖤 diamond on his back, his white 🤍 little toes, the coloring around his face, and even his vertical little ridge 🏔️ of hair that he has on either side of his neck. I am a very detailed oriented person and I could not find any flaws with this plushy of my pet Griffin - The Chihuahua. I bought this as a gift for my mother. Below is her response to the cuddle clone I ordered for her: My beloved dog Griffin is SO realistic. When I received it I cried. Thank you, Cuddle Clones, for the details/information you collected, which contributed to the artistry of making my pet Griffin into realistic plushy. I look at him everyday and say 'hi' to him; his eyes - the way he looks, it seems like he's looking directly at me, and it makes me tear up 🥹. This plushy of Griffin is such a special treasure to me. Many years of comfort, contentment, and peace will be given to me from my adorably realistic Griffin look alike that you made perfectly! I absolutely love this plushy and Griffin. Thank you🐾❤️🐾",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Crystal Mitchell,02/23/2023,"I had seen cuddle clones advertised before my sweet boy had to be cross the rainbow bridge and thought that would be a nice thing to have but I didn’t realize just how big of a void in my heart it would fill. Of course nothing could take the place of my Dane man but the cuddle clone is definitely a close second! It looks exactly like him all the way down to the little pink heart on his nose and the coloring under his ears and the pink coloring under his belly. His markings are perfect and to top it off he is about the exact same size as he was when I got him when he was a tiny little 18 lb 8!week old Great Dane puppy. I’ve slept with him every night since I’ve gotten him. I want another puppy but I know emotionally I am not ready for another so this is the next best thing. I cant recommend this excellent product enough! Some of the best money I’ve spent in a long time! Thank you Cuddle Clones for such an amazing product with such perfect attention to detail and amazing customer service. I also got the product several weeks earlier than expected. Very very pleased! If you are ok the fence about whether or not to get one, trust me! You definitely want one! When I’m sad, I snuggle up to mine and while it’s not the same- it does help to fill the hole in my heart.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Karina,02/19/2023,"We bought this cuddle clone of our dog a day after she passed away at 4 years old (GDV, search it up of you have large/giant breeds) and the wait was worth it so much. Now I have a physical representation of my dog that I can hug whenever I need to. I miss her so much but this definitely helps. They even got her uninterested look which was a lovely addition and it really adds some personality. They also got all her wrinkles and the spot on her chest/neck as well as her white paws. Honestly, I would recommend them to anyone because they're doing such lovely work!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Charlene Busch,02/18/2023,We had our fake Layla made for my mother in law that is in assisted living. She was not able to have her with her. It has brought her great comfort. The real Layla even gets jealous when we take her to visit!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patty N.,02/14/2023,Losing our sweet boy Drake was one of the hardest things our family has ever gone through. I ordered a Cuddle Clone hoping it would help with the void in our hearts and you nailed Drake's likeness spot on! Every time we see Cuddle Clone Drake we do a double take and remind ourselves it's not Drake. I even asked for a special request to have a few hairs sticking up behind his ear that we called his antenna and you did it! Thank you so much! I highly recommend Cuddle Clone to anyone grieving a beloved furry family member.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cassie,02/12/2023,My mom and I recently lost our Riley and his Cuddle Clone has brought us so much comfort as we try to adjust to him not being around. Thank you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bridget O'Donnell,02/12/2023,It was a very touching moment to see my wife unwrap a replica of our sweet Dark. It truly looks like her! Right down to the way she used to lie down and the colouring of her fur. She hangs out in our room and is perfect to cuddle with while we watch tv. Amazed at the craftsmanship and love that went into this gift!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cheryl Wall,02/09/2023,"I cannot give enough kudos to Cuddleclones. I was worried that they would not be able to match my beloved puppy, Tyson. You were spot on!!

Corinne M.,02/06/2023,"Losing a pet is never easy. It's the same as losing any other beloved family member. When our family childhood fur baby, Elsie, passed away the whole family had a piece of us ripped away. This was my brother's Christmas gift and he absolutely loves it. I thought he would just put the plush in his room, but my mom told me that he brings it around the house to keep him company (insert teary eyes here haha). My mom sent me a photo of him watching soccer on TV with the plush sitting next to him. It looks just like Elsie, it's so crazy! We all love it, and I think it was worth the wait while it was created. And if you are worried about the price, you can wait for a holiday sale (which is what I did)! Thank you for bringing Elsie back to us, even if it's just a plush version of her. Would def order again! I think it would be awesome if you expanded to other animals as well! Love, love, love!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Wendy C.,02/06/2023,"I wanted to get a cuddle clone of my dog, Handsome. The cuddle clone came out so good and it looks just like him.

Amanda,02/05/2023,"We had to say goodbye to our first baby last year and my oldest son asked Santa for her for Christmas. My heart broke and I had to explain Santa doesn’t have that kind of magic.

S Jackson,01/28/2023,"I am so elated with my Cuddle Clone. My eyes welled up with tears of joy when I first saw her. I've named her \Krash 2.0\"" and \""O.G. Krash\"" just loves \""herself\"" too. It is so very comforting to have an everlasting \""Krash\"". I highly recommend Cuddle Clones to all fur families.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Steve Overholser,01/27/2023,We had our dog Murphy for one month short of 15 years. He passed away unexpectedly just before Christmas. We wanted to have something other than photos of him and came across Cuddle Clones on the internet. We went through the order process and thought it was very thorough to order a likeness of the dog. He had a unique black and white coat and the staff did a great job to duplicate his features. While we can't replace his wonderful personality we can have this physical reminder of how special he was to us. We obviously could not compare the clone to Murphy but used a blanket we ordered from another source to show him off.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jamie W.,01/26/2023,"My kitty Bunny recently got a cancer diagnosis and I knew a wanted a cuddle clone. I also knew I wanted it it before she left me. It came much quicker than the 8 weeks. I received it in about 3. The feet and the tail are spot on. I love the name tag. The body coloring is good. I think the face is a decent interpretation of her. I do have to say my husband finds it creepy. Opening the package, the chemical smell is overwhelming. I do think there should be a note about it. I rubbed her down with dryer sheets and after a couple days it subsided. Overall I’m happy with my purchase and would definitely recommend.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Donna Dodson,01/26/2023,"My daughter had Joey for 17 years, almost exactly half of her life! He passed last year leaving her devastated!

Joey was a fluffy guy and it was amazing how he was perfectly captured.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Griffin,01/24/2023,"We ordered a Cuddle Clone for my 12-year-old, who asked for one after we had to have our elderly and beloved dog put to sleep. We ordered in November, and I told him it would probably arrive after Christmas, but it arrived in less than 3 weeks (just regular shipping), and is beautiful; Cuddle Clones even incorporated physical details about our dog that I didn't have a photo off for reference. Our son was thrilled and it's a lovely and adorable tribute to a lovely and adorable dog.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Debbie Metz,01/22/2023,This was a Christmas gift for my Mom. The dog was a clone! It is so awesome. My mom loved it! It is so much better as a gift before loosing your beloved pet. Thank you so much for an awesome job. The caregiver actually thought it was the real dog!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Alysha Cama,01/22/2023,"Absolutely love my cuddle clone of my Muffin! I lost my brother Muffin a few months ago and felt very lonely without my big gentle puff ball in my arms or on my lap. So I ordered a CC of my Muffin and the first one I ordered came in only 2 weeks, which was much faster than what I expected. The first cuddle clone of Muffin was really good quality and got all the minor details correct,, but not really a look alike of him. I was then contacted by the company's customer care service and they offered me a free remake of my brother. I agreed and sent them further instructions on what to change. This one took a bit longer to come but it was definitely worth the wait, it truly looked like my sweet boy. Everything from the general look all the way down to the most minor detail was perfect! His stubby legs, small face and fur colour were spot on. So thank you Cuddle Clones, for your great quality services and empathetic employees for helping me fill the void, at least physically, of my Muffin.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CJ Kennedy,01/20/2023,"I lost my beloved Finnegan one week after my 50th birthday in April 2020, at the same time the pandemic began and everything was locked down, and I had just found out I had cancer. It was the worst time to lose my best friend. That year was hard, and all the things at once (plus the fact he'd been so young, only 6, he died of congenital heart disease, nothing to be done about it), made my grief so much stronger than when I've lost other cats before him. I wept at least once every day for a year. My new cats are wonderful characters, but they are not cuddly huggers like Finnegan was. When I found out about Cuddle Clones, I was impressed by everyone's photos, so I decided to go for it. During the ordering process there were warnings that it could take at least 8 weeks to receive my order, especially as it was just heading into the holiday season. I was fine with that, but was blown away when I received it within 2 and a half weeks! The communications and support was excellent, informative and prompt. They did such a good job - they got his colouring just right, and I loved the little details like the little hairs that cats have going across their ears in the front, and the little 'eyebrow' hairs that stick up. It is such high quality, beautifully constructed. The only surprise was that it's quite stiff, and not soft and cuddly like a normal stuffed toy as I was expecting, more like taxidermy Lol, but that's okay, I got over it. Just a heads up in case anyone is expecting something more pliable like I was. I love being able to have 'Finnegan' sitting in his accustomed places again. Thank you Cuddle Clones.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Carla,01/20/2023,Our 14 year old died suddenly one week before Christmas. The holidays weren’t the same without her. The Cuddle Clone of her just arrived and is a perfect reminder that our sweet girl will always be with us in spirit! ❤️,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thanks again cuddle clones for making “jumping Jack” something she can hold once again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Lisa Fox,01/20/2023,"This is my Hoss, I was so worried it would be a total train wreck but I was pleasantly surprised at how well he turned out. Is the cuddle clone an exact match… no but I would say almost. Hoss was my soul dog and it gives me comfort seeing this replica of him. I would definitely get another one. I still have another dog and I am probably going to get one made of him, I will probably get his before he crosses the rainbow bridge. Thank you Cuddle Clones!!!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Janice Lewis,01/19/2023,I love my Chloe cuddle clone! My sweet Chloe passed away earlier this month and a friend suggested I get a cuddle clone of her. Couldn’t be happier! It’s like a part of her is still with me. I’m not sure what my other kitties think of it as evidenced by the picture!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This was a very special Christmas for us because we had to put Buck down do to health problems last October and we were devastated and lost with out him. Everytime I walk in the room I double take to make sure he's not real. A great job by your staff and I really appreciate it thank you all!!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ben D,01/17/2023,"My girlfriends dog passed away earlier this year, and as a Christmas gift I ordered her a Cuddle Clone of her late dog Suzy. I sent all the required pictures and even made an odd request to tuck her paws in like she used to do often. We both were blown away by the attention to detail and going above and beyond my expectation!! Would highly recommend Cuddle Clones, well worth your bang for your buck! Shipping was way faster then expected, they said a month and it was here in a week! Thank you Cuddle Clones!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Kelli B.,01/16/2023,I ordered this Cuddle Clone for my son after our 8 year old Papi-Poo named Toby passed away. My son loves it and I am very pleased with the way it came out. I bawled my eyes out when I first saw it because of how much it looks like our Toby! Thanks so much for a wonderful product that is bringing my son some comfort after the loss of his best friend!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Jenny T.,01/15/2023,"We’re doing double takes with our cat Felix and the Cuddle Clone version of Felix!!! So realistic they matched everything, even the cute black spot on his back leg and the little section of pink on his nose! Customer Service was great!!! I recommend to anyone!!! They did an amazing job with ours!!! Thank you to Cuddle Clones!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Carol Myers,01/14/2023,"SuzieQ was with us for over 18 years. Three years ago my husband ordered a replicate of our dog Zoe, a Yorkie terrier and puddle mix. We wore not happy with the results but no money back guarantee. When we lost SuzieQ, I decided to see if there was another company out there that specializes in replicating our pet. I was very pleased with the results but also with the initial contact and questions that this company asked to be sure they got the product right. As you can see by the photo they did. Thanks so much for allowiing our SuzieQ to bless our home.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Miley Vorsselmans,01/13/2023,"I'm so happy with my cuddleclone of my sphynx who passed away last year. I was nervous because a hairless cat as a plush must not be easy to create. And it worked out so good! The little wrinkles, even his little birthmark is there, and the tail is so realistic. I will forever cherish him ❤",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Kirsten Berol,01/12/2023,"Our little Jinx came in the mail yesterday and he is so much like the real thing! Jinx had a little scar on his hip which was recreated perfectly. Even the tiniest of details was represented like the little “paintbrush tail” he had. We had no idea what to expect but we are so happy with the final product. It is just like Jinx was and it is clear that this was made with attention to detail and, most importantly, with care and love. We couldn’t be more pleased!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Terri McHenry,01/11/2023," Cuddle Clones is the MOST AMAZING COMPANY!!!! They have with the kindest, most compassionate team and gifted artists of any company I have ever worked with! They are WONDERFUL people to work with for the two CC’s I ordered. Our beautiful 13 year old Shetland Sheepdog Mia passed away suddenly in September. We were beyond heartbroken to lose her unexpectedly. I ordered Mia’s Cuddle Clone and the artistic team recreated Mia’s facial features, body design, fur texture, fur length and fur color from photographs I submitted. It was a challenging project because Mia had a tri-color coat (black, tan, white). The clone had every feature from head to toe, back shape, ear shape and special markings all recreated exactly like she was in real life. Mia’s Cuddle Clone has made my husband so happy to have. It is just like her being with us again. After Mia’s older half sister (Brownie) passes I bought our daughter a Cuddle Clone of her as a Christmas gift. Brownie’s clone was made with the same loving care and beautiful, artistic detail as Mia’s clone. She has brought our daughter great comfort. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts for the beautiful work that you do Cuddle Clones friends!!! Your incredible techniques and artistry help our babies to live forever on in our hearts!!!!❤️🐶❤️🐶",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Anabelle,01/11/2023,"this is the best thing i have ever bought. it is simply perfect. my baby boy had to get euthanized right before christmas which really destroyed me. he was in my life for 15 years (i got him a 4 years old) so i didn’t know what was life without him. i knew i needed something to remind me of him so i looked up this company and immediately made an order. i received it a couple days ago and wow i was blown away. the cuddle clone i received looks just like my baby boy! there is so many detail and his fur looks exactly the same it’s incredible. i love him so much and i can’t stop cuddling him just like i did when my doggie was alive. yes it’s expensive, but it’s so so so worth the price. the company did such a good job i still can’t believe it. i recommend this company to everybody. they allowed me to have one of the best gift ever that i will cherish for all my life. thank you so much i am eternally grateful.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Customer,01/11/2023,When I got my cuddle clone I didn’t realize how often I would come home and see it and this my cat was there waiting for me to pet him. My fiancé and I almost called out for him a few times out of habit as we saw the stuffed animal in the window. It was bittersweet. The company did a great job. It is still a doll so it’s isn’t exact but pretty close,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Scott Trefethen,01/10/2023,"So going in I was nervous, as it was of our recently passed Big Lou. I have heard of other brands doing hatchet jobs and making truly scary plush's. I was getting super nervous when it shipped, I still had no idea what it was going to look like, until the day it arrived, and it looked just like Big Lou. I opened 2 tickets with customer service after I received it to make sure the people who did this were thanked and knew they were appreciated. Thanks Cuddle Clones, you really made my fiancés day with it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hans Boersma,01/10/2023,"Sunday, November 27, 2022 it's raining hard but our pointer short hair Schimanski, despite hating rain, wants to go outside with Nelly for a walk. It's going to be a big round. in the afternoon around 4 p.m. he becomes ill, he vomits and can no longer stand on his feet, and crawls away behind the bushes. Nelly brings him in where he remains on the mat. She calls Hans and he takes Schimanski at 160 km/h to a veterinarian on duty 25 km further away. A photo taken does not indicate a stomach tilt that we expected. He must stay the night. Monday, November 28, 2022 9:30 am phone from the vet, further investigation has shown that our Schimanski has liver cancer and cannot be operated on. The vet's advice is therefore to put him to sleep. Hans calls Nelly, who is in the hospital at the time, to tell her. Together we go to the practice and while Nelly sings Schimanski's favorite rhyme, our sweet happy dog falls asleep for good. Our grief is great, very great and the following weeks hardly get dry eyes. Then Nelly orders a Schimanski clone from Cuddle Clones and the package is delivered after a few weeks. Tears of emotion come out again, what a beautiful clone, what a wonderfully beautiful copy of our dog. We are very happy with this and will recommend it to everyone. A compliment to the customer service is also in order, friendly and customer-oriented they do their job. Chapeau !! Our Rex, Pointer wire hair, has been blind for 12 years and has osteoarthritis. Should he also pass away, we will certainly request Cuddle Clones to immortalize him as well. Once again our heartfelt thanks, Hans and Nelly Boersma. Holland",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sophia McDonald-Laugharn,01/10/2023,"We got this for Christmas for our 10 year old and he loves it! It’s honestly a little creepy, it looks so similar to our dog Forest that I flinch every time I see it 😂. We brought it out in public and people thought it was a real dog. Forest is skeptical of it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A.G.,01/09/2023,So incredibly accurate that the cat hisses at it! Even got the weird tail right! Highly recommend!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
N.,01/08/2023,My adult daughter missed her dog Shadow . Cuddle Clones collected pictures of her beloved Shadow and created a clone. My daughter loves her gift and considers her family.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cindy S.,01/08/2023,"I had lost my beloved Tonto on 12/21/22 and was so heartbroken. While grieving, the next morning of her passing, I was desperate on wanting her back and created a Cuddle Clone. I’m impressed with the detail. The only thing that’s a turn off is the chemical smell due to the airbrushing which makes this impossible to cuddle with. Also, I would like to inform those who may be considering a plush clone. This plush clone is a powerful reminder of your pet, this could potentially make it hard to carry on without your pet and please also consider others in the home as well. My family doesn’t want to see my clone because it would be too painful for them so I have to hide it and only bring it out on occasion when they are not around. The clone does provide a little comfort to me, but at times, it makes me miss her more. Just keep these things in mind before ordering. I understand everyone is different with grieving. This can also be a great way to honor a pet as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Deedra Barr,01/07/2023,For Christmas my husband got me a cuddle clone the pajamas and a mug of my beautiful cat Kevlyn. Everything is purrfect😻,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ellen,01/06/2023,I am very pleased with my cuddle clone. Customer service was responsive to my questions. The likeness to my cat is very good. I had been waiting for a good sale so last November I took advantage of the 50% off sale and ordered two.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bridget,01/04/2023,"They did an AMAZING job in cloning my dog as you can see from the two pictures! They asked for several more photos, the size of the snout and some other questions so that they could make him so real like. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I expected the fur to be more soft. The fur's kind of stiff, but that may be due to the dyes they have to use and not able to be softened. I had this made as a gift for my neighbor's child who is on the spectrum and in love with my dog so I was a little worried about the texture of the fur, but he LOVES him and takes him everywhere and sleeps with him! He is so real like, that it is freaky. I had him on the counter when he arrived and we kept thinking it was our actual dog on the counter! And, my friend says that she keeps getting freaked out when her son leaves him around the house because she thinks, \oh my god am I supposed to be watching Murphy and I forgot!\"". The ultimate compliment!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
B.D.,01/04/2023,"We purchased a Cuddle Clone for our 19th anniversary and I was excited to see how close they could replicate our dog. There are a few minor details they didn't quite get right like the stripe above his nose and there is a bit more black under his nose aswell. Overall I am really happy with my Cuddle Clone! I specially asked for them to get the markings of his chest right and they did just that! The tail and coloring they got perfect aswell. If you are thinking about buying a Cuddle Clone, I suggest that you put in specific details about your dog that you would like them to recreate so they look even more similar.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pam Thibodeaux,01/04/2023,Cuddle clone helped make my son’s dream come true. Our dog Miller passed away in 2021. I didn’t have the best pictures to send in.

Heather Miller,01/03/2023,"My Jolene was the absolute best companion ever. I lost her to IMHA at just over 1 year of age and didn’t know how to go on without her. My husband ordered a cuddle clone for me and it is truly amazing. Every possible spot, tail curl or ear flip is there. This clone has made me go forward and know that she is still here looking over our family. Thank you so much for this amazing creation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
J.M.,01/02/2023,My experience was amazing. We ordered a Cuddle Clone of our beloved feline Beetlejuice. When my son opened his Cuddle Clone for Christmas he thought Juice jumped in the gift. We are all impressed with the detail the artist put into our clone. Exceeded our expectations.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dena,01/01/2023,"While it doesn't look exactly like our cat, they did exactly what I asked with regard to special characteristics he has that endears us to the final product. Two very unique features are our cat's coat and his chin. They clearly spent a lot of time looking at the pictures I submitted and got his complex coat correct (a combination of black and brown stripes over a light color undercoat). The second feature is his large chin (underbite). They manage to capture that well too. I give them five stars for their attention to detail. Side note: this thing look real! Both my daughter and I caught ourselves a few times reaching out to pet it like it was one of our four living pets. You might find yourself doing the same thing. We've had a lot of laughs and fun with it. We might have to do it again with one of the other four-legged loves in our home.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ellen,12/30/2022,"I saw your post on Instagram and I knew it would make a perfect gift for my niece who was moving! When my clone arrived, he sat on my nightstand.

Kimberly Williams,12/30/2022,"My husband gifted a Cuddle Clone of my aging Ares. They requested lots of pictures of him, as a puppy and current. The recreated him beautifully. I cried like a baby! Couldn't be more pleased with the quality and attention to detail.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JerryH,12/28/2022,"I got five of these Cuddle Clones for my family members for Christmas this year. I got LeeLoo for my Son & Daughter-In-Law. She turned out great. She had a little rip in the belly seam which we will sew up easily. Her likeness is incredibly close to the real dog. Much smaller but, the same markings. The clones coloring turned out browner than the real LeeLoo who is more gray and white. Hence, the four star rating instead of five star rating. I hope this clone will provide some comfort to both of them when LeeLoo passes on and goes to the rainbow bridge. Hopefully, many years from now. I also got them a giant pillow with her face on it as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JerryH,12/28/2022,"I bought five total Cuddle Clones this Christmas for my family members. For my Sister-In-Law and Brother-In-Law, I got Bobbi-Jo. The clone turned out fantastic.

I also hope the little clone will provide them some comfort when Bobbi-Jo passes on and goes to the rainbow bridge. I also got them a coffee mug with his picture on it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JerryH,12/28/2022,"I bought five total Cuddle Clones this Christmas for my family members. For my wife, I got Brittany Speckles and Lillie. These clones turned out fantastic.

I also got her a canvas portrait of Brittany Speckles that turned out great as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JerryH,12/28/2022,I bought five total Cuddle Clones this Christmas for my family members. One dog Ruby who has already passed on and waiting at the rainbow bridge for my Daughter.

Chelsea,12/20/2022,"I recently lost my friend of 14 years, I have seen Cuddle clones online and always wanted to purchase one. The entire purchase was a pleasant experience. I was updated through the whole processs from when P-nut went into production to when he was completed and in the final check before shipping. In the emails my clone was not addressed as my purchase or my clone but rather by my pets name P-nut. The clone has a tag with my pets name on it and when I hugged him it felt like I was hugging my pet. With alittle brushing P-nut will look and feel like he never left us. I am more than happy with my purchase!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Customer,11/16/2022,"I was lucky enough to win a Easter picture contest years ago.and our prize was a cuddle clone! It was so simple take some pictures, pick your colors for the fur and eyes and sit back and wait! If I can remember, two weeks later our package arrived we instantly called her the other Molly! She was perfect! Molly loves her and so do we! A few months ago, Molly lost her leg due to Cancer, so now the other Molly and her are not exact twins anymore. It holds a special place because the other Molly, is just that. A time when we didn’t have all the worries, of surgery and chemo, We always say we wish we had more Mollys! And, luckily because of Cuddle Clones, we do!! It is the perfect gift for someone or for yourself!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Candace Battaglia,11/14/2022,"I honestly wasn't sure what I was going to get when I ordered this on a whim but I was shocked when it arrived. The clone of our Emmaline is absolute perfection and it brought tears to my eyes. My son was devastated when she passed away last May and has struggled with the loss. I fully intended this to be a Christmas present but seeing him so sad and crying about how much he missed her just broke my heart. I decided to gift her early and when he saw her he hugged her and just sobbed, but happy tears now. He snuggled her all night and she was the first thing he found when he got home from school. They're currently on the couch watching a movie together like they used to. Thank you so much for taking the time to make her just as she was. You got everything right. Her goofy eyes, her dark blonde ears and even the freckles on her nose. It truly means the world to me and my son.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cindy Kim,11/11/2022,"My sweet Potato passed away on Oct. 18, 2022 and he was almost 19 years old. Still looks like a baby and acted like one even to his end of days. I still miss him every day and decided to research what place had the best customized stuffed animals. I found Cuddle Clones and read all the reviews. Thank you for those that posted pictures! I felt like I knew your pets even though I never met them and Cuddle Clones did such a wonderful job with your pets that I thought, maybe I'll give Potato a try and see what Cuddle Clones could do for me. I received my sweet dear boy Potato today and it made me cry as I opened the bag to look at his sweet boi boi face. The eyes, nose, mouth, ears (wow such detail!) and even the way he sat looks just like him. Thank you Cuddle Clones for putting in the time, effort and love making pets look just like the ones we've had and currently have. Much appreciated to all of you at Cuddle Clones and I've been telling all my friends about you all. Much love to all the folks that have lost their loving pets. I'm so grateful to have Cuddle Clones recreate the pets we love.

It arrived much earlier than expected and was sooooooo similar looking! I was in disbelief they could make something so perfect with just some photos. They did ask me to provide a couple additional and paid close attention to detail. My family is heartbroken, but this will help us heal over time. Thank you!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Michelle,11/07/2022,I couldn’t be happier with my cuddle clone. As you can see by this picture Zeus my cuddle clone looks just like his sister Zena ❤️,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Amy Golesh,11/07/2022,I got my cuddle clone as a Christmas present from my now ex boyfriend and I absolutely love it thank you cuddle clones.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Kim,11/05/2022,This was a birthday present for my husband. Csonka passed away earlier this year and he has been missing him dearly. The tears we both shed seeing that face again was more than I was expecting. You captured him amazingly. We will be repeat customers and we will recommend your clones to everyone. 1000% worth every penny. Thank you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
W.S.,11/03/2022,"We recently had to say goodbye to our best friend and family member due to cancer, our 14 year old cat. Before he passed we had sent off for a cuddle clone. The timing was incredible, the clone actually arrived the day after we said goodbye. I had the thought before that this clone might be cute, but not a realistic representation of our boy. When we opened the package I actually did a double take. It’s amazing all of the details that they were able to capture! His fur length, his tail, the little tufts of longer hair and his whiskers were completely spot on. The truly amazing thing though is that they managed to capture his eyes and facial expression! It’s almost uncanny how much he looks like him. Sometimes when I enter the room I see him and for a second I forget that he’s a clone. I feel like this was sent on the exact day to help us heal. Thank you Cuddle Clone, the happiness you gave this family is beyond price.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Domenick Ciancio,10/31/2022,"My Cuddle Clone arrived earlier than expected. He looked just like my sweet sweet boy that left me recently. I had to let him go, but I think the cuddle clone helps me move on. I never want to forget my soul-dog who was my steadfast friend. Often, I will go to where I have him in a display case and feel good just remembering him. Thank you to the company and the artist for doing such a great job with quality and detail. The clone has weight and thickness to it and the fur feels soft and real. My black and white Jack Russell had some particular markings that the artist was able to replicate nicely. My dog was also missing an eye, which they made my clone a one eyed clone. I’m a collector, and Cuddle Clones made me my most prized possession. I will be returning to shop with this company. Highly recommended",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Edward Scott,10/30/2022,"While my beloved Maisie was alive, I had her cuddle clone made. Maisie got to see and sniff her likeness. This past October 6th, 2022, was when I had to let my baby girl go to that rainbow bridge. I stayed with my Westie girl throughout and after her passing. When I got home to my new apartment, I found the packed box with Maisie's cuddle clone and immediately opened it. I took her clone out and hugged it as I had with Maisie. Cuddle Clones are not just plush replicas of our pets. They are much more. They are the comfort that helps us through the grieving process and the physical, touchable entity that keeps our pet's spirit vibrant and with us. Maisie is with me, and to look at her cuddle clone face fills my heart with beautiful memories of her that will last forever. This is the magic of Cuddle Clones.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Julianne Barrow,10/29/2022,"I received Blondi yesterday and am finally happy with a purchase from cuddle clones. My first three standing shepherds arrived with hurt legs because my mailman shoved them in my mailbox. Thank goodness Blondi was delivered to my doorstep! She is beautiful! Blondi has been a long time character in all my books, my email and website start with her name not to mention her 5 puppies that will soon be included beside her! I appreciate Cuddle clones doing this for me. If you don’t know Blondi was one of the most amazing GSDs in history. She was able to jump high fences, climb trees, and was a loyal companion even though her owners abused her. Her story has been stuck on my heart for a very long time and I’ve always wanted a replica of Blondi by my side. Thank you Cuddle clones for making me my precious Shep. She will be cherished in her new home!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Beth Logan,10/28/2022,I absolutely LOVE the two clones I purchased!!!!! They are such a heartwarming remembrance of two dogs that I love with all my heart and miss so much!

I just got it today and I cried for 2 hours straight. It looks just like my Chewy. I love it more than words can ever describe. I will cherish this forever.

M.o.3.,10/24/2022,My sisters little princess Tori passed away at the age of 14 years just 2 months after her little sweetheart Tia passed away.. My family ached for her losses so close together. So what else could we do but “ clone” Tori too !! Once again you guys pulled through for us !! BEAUTIFUL work of art as well ! My only gripe is that the clone arrived very out of shape and it took a few weeks to fluff out before Tori truly looked like her ! Maybe a less compressing shipping method would work better. After all a work of Art should be treated with respect ! Other than that applause to your clone artist for another job well done !! Thank you for helping per parents heal ♥️,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
L.,10/23/2022,"I can't say enough good things about this company and the replica of my beloved cat Bella that they created for us. My cat and dog were best friends and Bella was our dear companion for 16+ years. After she passed away there were glaringly empty spots in our home where she would sit, sleep or explore and seeing those empty places reminded me of how much I miss her every day. We placed this replica where she would usually sit and it brings me peace and warms my heart now to see something that looks so much like our beautiful cat. If you are heartbroken over the loss of your pet, this doesn't replace them of course but it has brought me so much comfort and calls up fond memories instead of sadness. I can't say enough good things about how much this looks like our Bella and how much it helps ease the pain of losing an animal friend who was so special. It's a beautiful memorial and tool for helping to mend a broken heart.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
L.N.,10/22/2022," We had to put Ryder to sleep on August 17, 2022. His absence continues to be a struggle. There was some hesitancy in a plush replication of him…how close would it really be? If you have any doubts, let them go. I am blown away at the details and how accurate the plush is to Ryder. The day I received him he was sitting on the counter. I walked in the kitchen and almost said “Ryder get off the counter”. Having this plush that looks like my dog provides some peace and comfort. Thank you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Racheal Acklin,10/22/2022,"This was supposed to be a Christmas gift but she couldn't wait. There was happy and sad tears. She has been lost without him by her side.

A.P.,10/20/2022,"I already ordered from Cuddle Clones once before with my cat, so I wanted to do so again with Honey since we recently lost her. The most important thing I wanted done with Honey’s Cuddle Clone was to replicate her different shades of yellow, which was something I always loved about her as a yellow lab. The structure of her face is pretty similar, with the shorter and wider muzzle she had compared to my previous black lab. I could see that it was Honey herself and not just a generic yellow lab. Sometimes Cuddle Clone eyes can come off center and slanted, so I specifically mentioned to make sure they were centered and even, and the company listened. I would suggest specifically requesting this so they will be more likely to take extra care. Some things that I hadn’t even thought to add as specific markings, such as the spots on her nose and the scarring above her nose due to a sore she would rub at, were included and I’m surprised they picked up on it. I loved the inclusion of the zipper pouch and customer service was great with getting that added in last minute after I’d already accidentally submitted the order without it. Overall, I love it, and throughout the year I will put different bandannas on it just like we would with Honey.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
M.K.,10/20/2022,"The title sums it up. I truly could not have been more happy with my Clone. My baby girl was 6 weeks old, and I was 6 years old when I met her. Her name was Cuddles, poetically enough. We grew up together. I was lucky to experience life with her for 14 years. I was completely shattered when I lost her. 8 years later and I still cry at times. My fiancé didn’t get to meet her, unfortunately, but just through my multitude of stories and pictures, he quickly understood how special our bond was. He surprised me with this breathtakingly perfect rendition of my sweet angel. Every single detail is perfect, right down to the spots on her legs. They even portrayed her being a tripod in the most amazing way. I don’t have a single negative thing to say. It looks just like my baby girl is sitting in the house with me. Many big ugly tears were shed, in the absolute best way. Thank you so much for bringing my baby back home.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
P.F.,10/19/2022,"I wanted a Cuddle Clone for a while now and when my sweet pup of 17 years crossed the rainbow bridge, I knew I needed to get one to memorialize him. I was so excited and equally nervous to get it as I wanted it to be perfect. Needless to say, I am thrilled with my Cuddle Clone. Lots of tears when it came from both my husband and I. Our cats where even confused, thinking their old pal had returned! Google has lumped the pictures I took of the clone into the folder marked \Baxter\"" as it looks just like him! I had to send the clone back to have some very minor fixes (as I really wanted it to be perfect) - customer service was wonderful to work with and when he came back to me",it was spot on. I cannot say enough good things about my Cuddle Clone and highly recommend them to anyone who wants to have a look alike of their beloved.

A.W.,10/15/2022,"I couldn’t be happier with my cuddle clone. I recently lost my girl of 19 years and i was having a really hard time not being able to hold her, or pet her. Petting a picture frame really doesn’t do much. I wasn’t sure what to expect and when i opened the package i was so happy. It looks just like her. My friends even thought it was a taxidermy of her! Obviously it’s not an exact replica of her but it’s the most accurate i think a stuffed animal can be. I feel so much better now that i have this. So worth it :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

People were walking into each other staring at the clone having to see if it was real! I couldn’t be more pleased!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
M.H.,10/10/2022,"Thank you so much to everyone at Cuddle Clones for what you do. Your extremely thoughtful team’s careful attention to detail in all aspects of your service, from customer care to clone creation, is absolutely amazing. Cleo and I were together from when she was 3 months old in 2003 until she passed in 2022 at 19. She was my constant companion and best friend, following me everywhere and spending all our time together. Losing her has left such a huge space and I find being able to hold her cuddle clone to be such a huge comfort. All I could say when I opened her was “thank you thank you.” So, thank you. So so so much!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Debby DB,09/30/2022,"Thank you so much Cuddle Clones for bringing back my furry best friend Tiesto❤️🐾. Your artist did a very great job at catching my buddy’s features. His marks on his fur, his begging eyes and orange with black nose. Even his position when he’s laying. Tiesto was my best furry friend for over 20 years and I have a rough time without him cause he was always there for me when people couldn’t. I had him for more than half of my life so I miss him every second of the day.

J.,09/28/2022,"The reason for our request is due to the unexpected passing of our 2 year old kitten. I should have realized that too high of expectations could be emotionally damaging. The clone was not as we hoped but the customer service thus far has showed great compassion and willingness to remedy. That shows to me their commitment to excellence and customer satisfaction, so I very much appreciate that! We were told a one time refund is possible so we are awaiting that process. Thank you for the delicate handling and helpfulness.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Michelle Ting,09/05/2022, My family lost our first dog suddenly this past May. It came as an absolute shock and half of us were not able to say our final goodbyes to him. Cuddle clones does not replace the loss but it certainly did help provide my family with some comfort. The staff were so friendly and responsive to every single request and email which made the whole process so amazing. I like how the cuddle clone is supposed to be a stuffed animal version of your dog and not necessarily an identical clone but I will say there have been times that my family has mistaken that our past pup was in the living room with us. Thank you cuddle clones for making the grieving process a little more bearable and for allowing us to have something to cuddle when we miss our buddy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
J.M.,09/02/2022,I am beyond happy of the great job that was done of my boy Devo..I miss him so much but every time I look at my cuddle clone it makes me happy.Thank you so much for paying attention to all the details and making them look so real.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

C.,08/26/2022,"About a month ago my darling 15 year old Chappy cat passed away, it broke my heart beyond belief. The day after he passed I was telling my partner about Cuddle Clones. To try cheer me up, my partner was lovely enough to buy me a clone as a gift. I was anxiously waiting for my plushy to arrive as the reviews for cats were a real hit and miss. I'm from Australia and the total came to almost $400AUD!!! So this wasn't a cheap gift at all. My plushy ended up arriving within just 3 weeks instead of 8 which was amazing. I was ridiculously nervous opening the package. I'm not going to lie, when I opened it at first I had a good laugh because I thought his face was a bit funny. But then I realized it's a stuffed animal, not my real life Chappy. Of course it's face isn't going to look the exact same. Now I'm absolutely in love with it, everything is spot on. I can't believe how accurate the fur colour, the tail and the sizing is. I didn't even mention what size he was in the notes, Chappy was a very small cat and they got the sizing absolutely PERFECT! The more I look at him, the more I fall in love. I am so so sooo happy with my Chappy plushy. It is the best gift I have ever received in my whole life and I'm so happy that I can cuddle my Chappy plushy forever. Cuddle Clones is 100% worth the investment :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It's only been a month so this is still fresh. Their artists came so close to what Trixie looked like that her sister from the same litter starting crying as she approached it sitting on the bed, she started wagging her tail and with it sitting on the loveseat now, where Trix always sat, her sister is lying right next to her and hasn't left her side. I've sent a photo to show that. If you can fool her sister? Wow. The artists even got the details perfect on her which were her cherry eyes that she lived with her entire 11 years and mullet on top of her head! This is so amazing to me. Thank you Cuddle Clones! OMG. I mean, are you guys for real? I wish I could hug you! You've brought my girl back to life. I will cherish this for the rest of my days.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She said she didn’t think she would be able to but would try… that Christmas hidden inside of the suitcase I was gifted was my cuddle clone of Fae… and I love it! I got photos of Fae next to the cuddle clone and I love how accurate the clone is! … Now that Fae is gone that cuddle clone has been there for me to cry on and listen to my problems just like she used to listen to my problems… so thank you! Thank You Cuddle Clone for giving me something to hug and talk to while remembering the good times I had with Fae!

A.A.,08/07/2022,I had to give away my cat and have been so sad about it. We gave him to a family member so I see him about once a month still but they probably won’t be able to keep him much longer. I don’t really have anyone else and the saddest thing is we’ll most likely have to give him to a stranger. I got this so I could still have something that reminds me of him. They even made his paws pink. It came 3 weeks sooner than expected. I didn’t pay for rush shipping.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ramona Allen,08/05/2022,"I do not know how to express how realistic this clone of my Dottie Dog is. The artistry and team that made this from what pictures and information I sent is just unbelievable. I opened my package and did not cry like I thought I would. But, I shed tears when I brushed out her coat (as the tag recommended) as I did so many of her 15 years. She has been gone 2 years or this would have been so hard to see her life like likeness. Now, after 2 years I can have her with me as I remembered her looking and where she loved to sleep on the sofa. Cuddle Clones was so patient with me as I remembered to tell them things I remembered about her that her pictures did not convey. I am still amazed at how they did this. I asked for a pose of her waking from a nap upon hearing me speak to her. They did this perfectly.

Heather Davenport,07/29/2022,"This product is amazing and such great quality. Not only did it arrive a month before it was supposed to, it also looks identical to our baby Tank. He has cancer and unfortunately doesn’t have much time and I’m so happy we got this for our girls to remember him by. I would recommend this company to anyone! So happy with my purchase.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Angela O'Guin,07/20/2022,"I lost my baby Sophie a month ago. She was 14.5 years young and the only child I ever had. I have been trying to find ways to heal from her loss and it has been very hard for me. I placed my order with Cuddle Clone but had very low expectations that they would be able to capture her, like so many of the other's I saw in the reviews. Well, I am just completely shocked, they got her perfectly!!!!!!!! I cried so much and all I could do is stare at it. It is like I am looking into those pudding eyes of hers again. For the first time in 4 weeks, my heart feels less pain. Thank you just does not feel like enough for what you guys have done. I wish I could hug you all. I have a lot more healing to do and I know it is going to be a long road, but I want you all there to know, that you have been huge part of my healing journey. You are making a HUGE difference in people's lives, especially for those of us who have lost our babies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

L.S.,07/19/2022,"My Alvin passed over the rainbow bridge in February...I missed him so much I ordered a Cuddle Clone. The likeness is almost spooky, but I absolutely love him! The coloring & the tail were the most amazing! This has filled a hole in my heart. Thank you Cuddle Clones!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mandy,07/19/2022,"When I first received my Clone I wasn't too happy. It looked mostly like her but a few things threw me off and, for the price, I wanted them fixed. Perhaps the pictures I sent weren't good enough? Either way, after I submitted my review, I was contacted about a free remake. I listed exactly what needed changed and I sent it back out. Within a couple weeks I was sent my new and improved Clone and I couldn't be happier. It kinda freaks my real cat out but that's how you know it's good! I'm so so happy with the remake and thankful for the customer service team being so quick to reach out and caring so much about my requests. I would certainly recommend this company because they may not get it right the first time, but they do care about customer satisfaction. They will even offer a partial refund if you decide against the remake.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jeanne Anderson,07/18/2022,I gave this to my sis for her birthday and she loved it! Hit the mark as you can see by the pictures.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mom of 3,07/17/2022,I just have to thank the artist that created my sisters beloved Tia !! I’m so impressed!!! This is the 3rd clone in our family .

It soothes our souls after they pass on over the rainbow bridge. Thankyou you are truly a special company ❤️,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dianne Love,07/14/2022,"They nailed it. We're flabbergasted. We keep thinking Scout's here when she's in another room. They nailed the floofies, the coloring, the fuzziness. I bought a bandanna that's too big for Scout 2.0, but we'll use it on the real Scout. So many thanks, worth every penny. Now when Scout is gone, Scout 2.0 is here for a cuddle. You guys rule.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Customer,07/10/2022,"Sadly, My sweet Roxi Girl died in May of 2022 from Breast Cancer! Needless to say, I have been extremely heartbroken ever since! My sister also lost her dog and ordered a clone from Cuddle Clone. It was an exact clone to her dog, on color and size, so I decided to order one for my Roxi Girl! I was so overwhelmed when I open my package! Cuddle Clone’s did a fantastic job. It looks just like her and although Roxi can’t move around like she did when she was here, but when I look at her I feel a part of her is still here with me! It’s ok to have ashes, but it’s wonderful to have a part of your pet that is tangible. It is certainly helping me heal my broken heart! I wish I could have her back, but know that will never be but this is the next best thing! Thank you Cuddle Clone’s for doing a fantastic job on Roxi Girl! I absolutely LOVE her!!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chastity Morrison,07/04/2022," I lost Baby Okami in March of 2022. I was devastated and an emotional wreck. When I received my Cuddle Clone I started crying happy tears. She was perfect, Baby is home and I will forever get to see her. I didn't know how much I needed her until I got her. Everyone I talked to with Cuddle Clones was absolutely fantastic. Even when I added more detail to make sure she was perfect. So Thank you so much.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A.M.,07/01/2022,"They did an amazing job recreating my sweet Princess Sophie! I had recently put her down and while I had another dog, the loss of her was tough. They said it would take about 8 weeks to receive my CC, but amazingly enough it came in exactly 4 weeks from the date I purchased it. Which ironically happened to be my birthday, so it was the greatest birthday present having my precious Princess Sophie back with me!!! It has really filled the void I felt after I put her down, and would recommend one to anyone!!! Thank you ❤️",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hera Donaldo,06/24/2022,I love my cuddle clone. It looks so much like my Jaq down to her little bald spot on the top of her head. It took a while to get used to seeing it. At first I'd get freaked out that there was a dog on my coffee table or my work desk. Got two more precious fur babies and will get cuddle clones of them too!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Kelsey Smith,06/24/2022,"Cameron and I were a dynamic duo for almost seven years when he was diagnosed with heart failure. I took him to the cardiologist, got him on some medication, and adopted a feline brother to keep him company. We got to spend two more years together before he left me at the beginning of May. He was my whole world and I wasn’t ready to say goodbye. I just wanted him back so badly I took the risk of ordering a cuddle clone and I’m glad I did. Cuddle Cameron is such a good likeness and hugging him is almost as good as the real thing. If you are missing your fur baby, this is a great way to keep them present. I’m grateful for the attention to detail and the respect the cuddle clone team showed my sweet boy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MVP,06/23/2022,Our first dog ever passed away 2 months ago and his absence has been so hard. I saw Cuddle Clones on an Instagram influencers page shortly after he passed and decided to order one. It’s so well done - the design team got the coloration and texture of his fur just right! Even his tail and the shape of the back of his head are on point! When I sent a picture over to some friends they thought we got another dog that looked like him! Thank you Cuddle Clones for this beautiful memorial of our beloved boy!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pam Hawley,06/22/2022,"I ordered a standing version of my red heeler (cattle dog). It is so lifelike that my dog was scared to death of it when I placed it on the floor. She loves stuffed animals, but this one looked too real for her taste. Thank you for doing such a fabulous job of creating this cuddle clone!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mindi,06/20/2022,"I didn't know what to expect when I ordered my mom's recently passed away dog Zoey. It was almost TOO realistic when opening the package, it looked like our dog completely. Completely recommend cuddle clones.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Please give my heartfelt thanks and love to everyone who helped create “Teddy Bear”.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Kaye D,06/15/2022,"My soul mate animal passed away 6 weeks ago, and my sister gave me this cuddle clone as a remembrance of him. It was the sweetest, most thoughtful gift ever, and I cried when I received it because it felt like looking into my boy’s eyes again. Everyone who has seen the clone has remarked about how amazingly it looks like the real animal. All the details were exquisitely done, and my sister said the customer service was excellent. She received it quicker than expected. She was told 8 weeks, but it only took 5. She was regularly informed of the progress, and the people who communicated with her were very friendly and professional to deal with. Every time I walk into the room, I am startled by the likeness, and my heart smiles every time I see it. Thank you to Cuddle Clones for this beautiful keepsake of my sweet boy. I will always treasure it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
John Noto,06/14/2022,We lost our beloved pup of 13 years just a few months back. I can’t thank Cuddle Clones enough for the care and attention to detail they put into creating our dog.

Richard Brocato,06/11/2022,"My Harley Boy plush cone is amazing! It makes me smile every time I look at him. The number and type of required poses of my pup gave a good representation of what Harley Boy looked it. My finished plush clone very closely resembles my pup. Family and friends that knew Harley, the first time they see him are astonished how well Cuddle Clones captured the look and markings of my pup. I love how the furs feels on his back when I pet him. Thank you for immortalizing my sweet Harley Boy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jacqueline Bell,06/11/2022,"There is a standard shape/body that each breed has. But each dog is an individual coming from its own genetic makeup. Some Shelties look like they are part Pomeranians and some the more sturdy Collies. You can't just take something off the mold shelf and then spray on features. But the artist can only do so much with the stock available to her. I would have preferred smaller ears and a profile that doesn't look like a sausage but with a bit of bending and brushing, this Cuddle Clone of my Sheltie came close. Much of it has to do with angle. As you can see it is on the sofa. On the pillow next to it is a photo of my Sheltie. Pretty darn close as possible considering what elements the artist had to work with. The more I look at it, the less I see individual faults but in an entire view a few feet away, it looks like him which is comforting (I cried when I held it)..thanks",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cassie,06/09/2022,Pepsi was my world and I was her world. We were inseperable. Her cuddle clone helps with the greiving process for me after losing her. Thank you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Scott,06/01/2022,Didn't have the highest hopes when I ordered this for my mom. But we were both mind blown when it showed up. The attention to detail was amazing. People thing it's my moms old dog when I show them pictures. Would 100% recommend. The only downfall was the black on the lip went all the way down on the dog and on this one looks like a mustache. Small ignoreable detail for how good this turned out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Brenda Calhoun,06/01/2022,We recently lost our Big Boy Axle. He used to sleep with our 10yr old son and was his fierce protector and best friend. Needless to say he took it the hardest when Axle suddenly passed away. I got the Cuddle Clone for him in the hopes of easing the pain and help him fall asleep. He has not stopped loving on it since we received it. He sleeps well again and talks to him as of his best friend was still alive. I’m so thankful that I found Cuddle clones because it eases his pain and as a mother I couldn’t stand to watch him hurt so much. Definitely worth every penny and the wait!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Jon,06/01/2022," Doing this AFTER a pet has died is very difficult because of the angles that you need to get the proper details. Obviously, when you’re missing your buddy, nothing is going to look fully correct because you know in your mind that “this is not them because they’re never coming back”. But if you look at it objectively from old photos, it’s surprising how close it actually is. The color gradient and little curves of different colored lines in the fur was acknowledged in the production and show that they paid close attention to the photos even when you think “man. I didn’t think they caught that” or “I forgot about that marking”. I got mine made of my 13 year old pitbull that died on April 18th. I went through all my pictures for the ones needed for this and submitted my order on April 30th. It got here on May 31st which was quicker than I was expecting. They even got her forehead wrinkles which I didn’t think showed well in the pictures. From the back, it looks just like she’s watching tv with me again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dale Sabin,06/01/2022,Super impressed. My wife and I really love it. It came out better then I expected. Thanks for taking the time work on the detail. A+,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rosalind Sibulkin,06/01/2022,I lost my boy Avi 2 weeks into his 8th birthday this past October 2021 to cancer. The devastating loss has been too much to bear.

Thank you so much for performing an amazing job.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ashley,05/29/2022,"Holy cow, I am beyond pleased with my CC. We lost our bub in January and I ordered his clone the day he crossed the bridge. It took about 6 weeks to receive the first one. However, the eyes were the wrong color/damaged and it was a bit scary in the face (photo with side by side comparison). So we took the chance and asked for a remake since it had to be returned to have the eye color fixed anyway. Another 7 weeks or so went by and I'm absolutely floored by how perfect the remake is (solo photo). I bawled opening the package. Cuddle Clones gave me my nugget back. It looks so much like our bub and I am so thankful to have found this company. Thank you!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

J.C.,05/25/2022,"I am very thankful for Cuddle Clone going the extra mile to make my pet perfect. Your products and customization skills really bring your clone to life. When I submitted my order I realized there was no tongue color option knowing my pup has a purple tongue. I emailed them right away, but there's no guarantee due to it being submitted. They made it happen so thank you for going the extra mile trying to master this and i hope in the future you add this tab as you customize your pet. Something funny this clone catches our eye thinking it's real which is super interesting. Let alone my cats think it's real as well. Lol!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The two of us were so attached to one another and I couldn’t have thanked him enough for helping save my life every single day! I got my cuddle clone of him in today and both my husband and I started ugly crying when we opened the package. They got every single detail of my goodest boy! I am beyond in love with it! I am going to be able to sleep better at night knowing I can still get some Kosh cuddles in. Seriously worth every penny I paid. ❤️ Thank you so much Cuddle Clones for this wonderful clone of the most special doggo there ever was!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cara McGuire,05/20/2022,"I want to thank the team for all the love and care that they put into my clone of Piper. She was my child, my soul dog, my baby girl.

Jazzie's mom,05/16/2022,"I received my Cuddle Clone today and I have to say I am very pleased. I ordered this knowing that it would be bittersweet when I got it, because what I really wanted was my sweet girl back and there is no way to do that- but this is the next best thing. I am really impressed with the coloring especially on the ears, and even though some of the pictures I gave you were of her as a puppy, and some were of her older and losing hair, you still managed to make her look young and healthy, with some of the graying around the face that I had grown so used to. Thank you so much for this lovely tribute to my baby.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stacey,05/16/2022,The resemblances to my littlest best friend are so precise… they even got his balding spots on the tail and where his collar sat. This is the perfect keepsake for my children… and the correspondence on the process was amazing!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Antonio,05/15/2022,"We lost our Midnight last month and it left a hole in our hearts. I heard about Cuddle Clones and immediately asked them to bring her likeness to life again. What was supposed to take eight weeks only took four, and when I nervously opened the package to find her, I cried tears of happiness. They brought her back to us, nailing everything from her fur to the bald patch on her belly. The one thing I was disappointed with was the pouch not being big enough to hold her ashes, but I supposed I should have asked about that first. We still love you Midnight, and this will always remind us that you loved us too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Molly Griffin,05/14/2022,"I am devastated over the loss of my goldendoodle, Maggie, who died at the age of 12 and a half with hemangiosarcoma, an aggressive cancer. Today, when I received my Cuddle Clone of her, I broke into sobs. Maggie looked exactly like Maggie. The care and precision from the pictures I sent is unbelievable. It was almost like they knew Maggie, as they replicated her expression, perfectly. They airbrushed the golden streaks that she had in the exact spots. The talent that these people have is beyond anything I imagined. It seems like Maggie is sitting on the chair looking at me, with the same expression. I can't thank you enough for the beautiful job you did in creating a cuddle clone of my beloved Maggie.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Joseph Perry,05/13/2022,At first I thought it was a very high priced stuffed animal. Bu scooter is an extention of my wife herself. There always side by side. So I thought. What the hell. When it arrived I was very impressed. I'd have to say money very well spent. And seeing my wife's face. Well you can't put a price on that 😉,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Miguel Rodriguez,05/10/2022,"I meant to leave a review a while back but I wanted to leave a great review here for Cuddle Clones. The team that made my Buddy clone did a fantastic job on it! Looks just like him, more when he was a puppy. I'm very happy with my product! Thank you so very much!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stacy S Rhodes,05/10/2022,I love my Cuddle Clone of my dog Disco....clone is Frisco. Pretty good likeness!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
kevin knope,05/09/2022,"After the very unexpected loss of our buddy Oscar, who brought enormous joy to both my wife and I, we came across Cuddle Clones and decided to have them replicate our Oscar. Overall, they did a fantastic job with his colors and markings and recreating the pose we wanted to have done. When we first opened the package, we were both leery as to how he would look. We couldn't have been happier with the craftsmanship that was put into this and giving us at least a little something back to always have his presence in our home. We know it can sound a little weird, but other pet owners will know what we mean when we say, Oscar had a larger-than-life personality. He ruled the house, and our other cats (including us) knew he was the King of the Castle, the Head Honcho and everyone just gravitated to him! Oscar dictated everything! lol :) We've had our Oscar clone for a few weeks now and both of us still do double takes because of how well he turned out. The only negative we can bring up is his size is a little off, but we understand it's difficult to get the true essence of the size of something from a picture. Oscar was a big cat, he was long and had a broad chest as he was 17lbs, yet the clone looks like he did when he was about year and a half old not his size when he left us too soon at 6 years old. Even though his size was off, like we already stated we understand it's difficult to truly get the size right from a picture, it wasn't enough to not give them 5 stars on the rating because everything else was spot on. Thank you, Cuddle Clones, for doing such a wonderful job and having him shipped to us under the time frame stated in the ordering. We now will always have a little bit of our Oscar with us every where we go.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Lo He,05/09/2022,"See, normally I’m not the type to leave reviews anywhere. But with this, it just exceeded my expectations and had to show y’all the results. We lost our furry friend this year in March. My mom was the closest to our pet & I decided to get her a clone for Mothers day. Let the reaction in the video speak for itself. We all loved it! Thank you Cuddle Clones for an amazing job!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Kassy Steiger,05/05/2022,I lost my beloved pup Bentley a few months ago. He was young and I saw him as my child. He was there with me through it all so when I lost him it was hard for me. I stumbled upon cuddle clones and thought it would help if I had something physical to remember Bentley by and it touched me if I can have a “clone” of him. Bentley passed by getting hit by a car and my last memories were horrific sights. This has helped me tremendously being able to look into his eyes and remember his true self. Cuddle clones replicated my boy so perfectly. They got him pretty much to scale. His collar actually fits his clone perfectly like it fit his real body. His coloring is pretty accurate seeing Bentley had a very unique coloring for his breed. Communication was great and if they had any questions I was able to answer and communicate quickly. The turn around time was also very impressive seeing it was a custom pattern. Overall I am extremely satisfied and if given the opportunity I would order again. This helped me grieve in a way I didn’t think is possible. I am now able to cuddle my boy every night like he always did. I can’t thank them enough.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Brittany Gracie,05/04/2022,"I ordered a cuddle clone stuffed animal when my fur baby passed away. I was looking for a tangible way to honor my dog and preserve the wonderful memories of him I have. My little guy was a brussels griffon (a relatively rare breed in the United States). I was a little concerned about how the finished product would look. Many griffon illustrations and products don't look anywhere close to how they should. I was pleasantly surprised at how well my clone turned out. There were a few differences between my actual dog and the clone. It was mostly proportions and the fact that his nose wasn't set high enough. I think it's just because he was a rare breed and photos can only capture so much vs actually seeing one in real life. All in all, I was very pleased with my cuddle clone. I've never seen a more convincing plush of a brussels griffon. The eyes are so spot on it's kinda crazy. I also want to say that I believe the price was very reasonable in today's economy. It was a little over $200 for the plush. When you consider the costs of creating an individualized pattern specific to one's pet and the detail that goes into sewing and crafting these clones, it's well worth the cost. I also opted for 4 week shipping at an extra cost. I received my cuddle clone in a little over 2 weeks, so that was a nice surprise. Personally, I am very happy with my purchase and believe it was money well spent.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Amanda,05/03/2022,"Our family was devastated when we lost our 12 year old Cane Corso suddenly. Cuddle Clones brought him back home and my girls were so excited! Their clones look identical and I could not be more happy with how they turned out, they really captured all of his special features! Thank you for making our family whole again!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Beth,05/03/2022,I was very pleased to receive my Shelby plush. We lost her just the day prior to me ordering. We were taking our loss pretty hard and started researching memorabilia when we came across this company. I ordered one right away. The company was very compassionate and cares about getting our pup just exactly the way she was. They got everything great from her crooked ears down to her light patched tummy area where she had been shaved for her spay. I plan on ordering another of our other dog we lost few years ago to cancer. Thank you to the company who does this!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cheryl Wagner,05/01/2022,Seven weeks ago I had to say goodbye to my 16 yr old Bailey who had been by side for 14 yrs. I am absolutely thrilled with how my Cuddle Clone came out. The first picture is my clone and the 2nd pic is actually Bailey. It looks just like my sweet girl who will forever live in my heart 💖,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bridgette Ward,04/30/2022," Thank you so much Cuddle Clones. We lost our Smoke a few weeks back and it has shattered my sons heart. He was his sleeping partner and best friend. It has left a hole in our family. Our Cuddle Clone came in today. As soon as my son opened the package, he said “Is that my Smokey Bear??” Then the tears. Happy and sad tears I’m sure. Smoke is perfect. A complete replica. The markings are identical. Ordering process was a breeze. We even had to upload additional photos for you to get him absolutely perfect. Thank you so much! The hole in our family is now partially filled. P.S. The attached is of him straight out of the package. Please excuse his ratchetness. I’m sure he will be much more beautiful after some fluffing. 😉",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Andrea Aguilar,04/29/2022,"Ok to start things off, I’ve heard these take a long time to make and arrive, so I was willing to wait around 8 weeks, but NO! The project was picked up WAY earlier! I was excited but I was scared that it would be rushed. When I got a text that it was shipped, oh man I was happy I had to tell everyone. It arrived today and I am in LOVE. They have all her details, and even she loved it! The bottom tag has her name, and I love the tag on the ear with the wonderful words! My little Lucy wouldn’t stop rubbing herself against it! Now I can have her a very long time, even when I’m old and gray. Thank you Cuddle Clones. I highly recommend this to everyone <3",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Becky,04/29/2022,"Got it much earlier than expected, but the plush is AMAZING! Will definitely be ordering from again!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Aaron D.,04/28/2022,"My pup passed away a week after I ordered this product. When I received the package and opened it up, tears streamed down my face. I didn't know what to expect, but the team at Cuddle Clones did a fantastic job capturing the most important features. I am beyond pleased and will be ordering another of my other pup. Thank you for your awesome job!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Devin T,04/27/2022,"I ordered a cuddle clone as soon as I found out my old kitty had kidney disease. I wanted to be prepared. They took all my requests and made them real, and the plush came sooner than I was expecting. It doesn’t look exactly like my cat, but I’m very happy with the product. I only need to figure out a way to get the ‘factory’ type smell out of the plush. It brings me great comfort to hold and squeeze it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Kelly Green,04/22/2022,"We ordered the plush toy for my youngest since our dog is getting older and is her best friend. We couldn’t believe when we got it how similar it was and the colouring was spot on. Since we received it a few days ago my daughter as brought it with her everywhere and sleeps with it every night. I have recommended cuddle clone to everyone that ask, even though by the time we got it, it was much more money then we thought but so glad she can have her mini mya with her forever",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rachel,04/21/2022,I’m super happy with this purchase. I sent in pictures of our dog Mandy and described how I would like the plush. The plush is just what I wanted. Looks like her and it’s the perfect size— smaller than Mandy like I requested. And she’s a unique looking dog. I’m Impressed with the plush!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A.C.,04/21/2022," I lost my dear Oreo in March of 2020. My constant companion of 14 years. When looking for ways to honor his memory and help me move forward, I discovered the Cuddle Clones website. I read reviews and looked at pictures. I hesitantly decided to give their product a try, noting their guarantee and what others had said about their customer service. I received my Cuddle Clone last week, as a rush order. While he is definitely not an exact replica of my buddy, he is a convincing stuffed animal creation that makes me smile when I look at him. The attention to detail, his markings, his uneven saddle across his back, his white crown…it is great. The face is slightly off to me, but I’ve decided it’s because it’s not a live animal. It’s the life in our sweet babies’ faces that make them who they are. This is enough. Thank you Cuddle Clones for giving me a tangible, holdable reminder of my sweet Oreo.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Romina valenza,04/21/2022,"I ordered my replica one month ago and despite I am on the other side of the world, yesterday i got it I ove my little replica-dog, it's perfect!!! Thank you Cuddle Clones ❤️",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pammie F.,04/20/2022,"I ordered a cuddle clone plush by submitting pictures of my for baby in many ankles. I receive the most beautiful plush I have ever seen in my life with such a remarkable resemblance of my fur baby. I highly recommend this product to everyone, of their pets who are living or who have passed over the rainbow bridge. This plush will give me joy that will last me a lifetime!! Thank you for so much detail!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jill,04/20/2022,I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. I hesitated because it was a pricey endeavor but it turned out amazing! My family had the greatest time seeing the two dogs side by side. The artist did an amazing job! My dog has sort of difficult fur too and it looks just like her! They also reached out to me to get extra photos and details.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nidhi,04/19/2022,I love u guyss . My order came early then i expected . For a moment me and my family felt like its our dog tuffy in front of us . Thank you for making my order ❤️❤️🥺🥺,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chasiti King,04/19/2022,This is my second Cuddle Clone that I’ve had made. Our first one was of our Daisy. She was our baby for almost 14 years and the second one is our Maisey. Sadly she passed away only a week after we got her. Cuddle clones did not disappoint either time. This is the best for anyone missing a beloved pet. It doesn’t bring them back but it helps to have something to have and hold on to when your having a bad day. Thank you so much Cuddle Clones. I attached photos of our babies and their Cuddle Clones.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
T.T.,04/19/2022,"Sinve my Poe passed away, I have been TOTALLY lost and heart broken without him by my side. He has been my entire world for over 9 years, and his losing was so unexpected, which made it even harder. I didn't know how I was gonna get through each and every day. I was shopping on the internet, looking for different memorial items to buy to show redirect and love for him. Than I came across this company, Cuddle Clones, and I thought I needed to order 1 as I felt an emptiness. I was worried about it not looking like my precious angel, Poe, but when I received the item, I was completely in shock how much it looks exactly like him, right down to the nose, the eyes, mouth, the cow lick of hair on his head, the way he crossed his front legs, and always had his legs out to the side when he was lying down. I have to say, I am VERY impressed. It has been helping me with my depression. They took every pic I sent them, and put together every detail, to make an exact clone of my baby boy. I have actually walked into my room a few times, and for a split second, thought Poe was lying there on my bed. Thank you Cuddle Clones, for giving me an EXACT replica of my baby boy, Poe. Here is a picture of my Poe, and a picture of the clone",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
T.O.,04/18/2022,Thank you Cuddle Clones for creating a beautiful replica of my beloved Wolfdog Shepherd mix. I lost him unexpectedly to cancer of the spleen just last month and this will means so much and will be cherished forever . I know you guys work hard to create the perfect replica and I thank you with all my heart. ❤️,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
G.S.,04/18/2022,"We ordered this for our granddaughter who is going to college this year. I know she will miss her dog terribly, so we got this for her. It really does look like her dog also. Excellent workmanship. We absolutely love it and can’t wait to give it to her at graduation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tiffany Pierce,04/17/2022,"My sweet girl, Tigger died last month and I ordered a cuddle clone of her the next day (not entirely impulse as it had been something I was considering). I had been a little worried as there are not a lot of cat reviews on here and they all seemed pretty hit-or-miss, but I opted to take the chance. While not alot of email updates, I was contacted to reconfirm her fur color, which made me happy as I knew her buff coloring might be hard to pin down. Her clone arrived yesterday and I was blown away! It looks so much like her and while not 100% accurate (it is still a plush after all), the fur is really close! Her face is a little wonky from the side but I feel it's part of the pattern they used for this version of cat, but her front view is adorable! The only thing that really bothered me are the ears. They're attached at an angle that puts them sticking straight up, it almost makes her look like a lynx at a glance. If you're getting a cat clone done, I would suggest asking them to either shrink the ears a bit or try to set them a little lower down the side of the head. All in all, a wonderful plush that I will treasure always. Thank you for giving me some of my sanity back.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Veronica L.,04/16/2022,"So my dog Drago passed away a few months ago. So having a cuddle pet of my lost pup. Is amazing. Its very realistic. Maybe a bit chuckier then him, but still perfect. They even got his trademarked smirk right. :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Niki Romero,04/14/2022,"My sweet Jrzy passed away March 18th 2022. I ordered a Cuddle clone of her that day and it just arrived. Jrzy was born in our house and with me every day for happy 13 years so her loss has been devastating. I cannot believe how much it looks like her. I love it so much. We were stunned when I opened the package. I need to give it a good brushing, but it looks so much like my sweet Jrzy. They got her spots, thin waist and legs, large chest and posable ears and tail as those changed with her mood. Thank you so much for all the effort and care put into this perfect plush of my beloved family member.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Wendy Ainsworth,04/14/2022,"The first three pictures are of my little dog that sadly passed away at 16. The last two are my cuddle clone I received here In The UK It’s just perfect. My little dog walked me down the aisle and was with me through thick and thin. So devoted and such a beautiful, kind and loving dog. It broke my heart when she passed away. So I put my trust into cuddle clones and I am not at all disappointed in any way. The attention to detail, even her name sewn on a tag label was beautiful. The colouring and the pose spot on. I love, love love mine. So when my days been hard or unbearable ( I’m disabled ) I can hug my cuddle clone and somehow it eases my pain. Thank you so much.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The moment i pulled her clone out of the packaging, I started crying, happy tears. Neelas clone, I feel was made with love and care and is the spitting image of her. When my dad saw, the words holy moly came out of his mouth with eyes all wide. Neela was my daughter, my Best friend and my heart. Thank you, Thank you to all who helped create Neelas clone. You captured my babygirl on point. And to your staff who helped me understand the process and kept me updated with the progress. So happy with my cuddle clone and so grateful!

Liza,04/12/2022,"Our sweet Benson passed away March 1st 2022. It’s been a hard time, and when I opened my cuddle clone today, I cried. I was worried they wouldn’t be able to capture what Benson really looked like, because he is just white, no special markings... somehow they managed to make him look identical, even his eyes.. his eyes are what get me. They even got his tail right. I am so happy with it. It’s helping my children heal from losing their loving pet. So thankful this option exists. Thank you Cuddle Clones! ❤️",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ashley Bell,04/04/2022,I love my cuddle clone. My cat Molly passed away at 14 due to Squamous Cell Carcinoma (bone cancer in her jaw). I wanted something to remember her by. She came out so beautiful and lifelike. Although there were some small imperfections like shape of her face being a little different everything else was so spot on! Her coloring and markings were incredible. It does take a while but it’s well worth the wait! I look at her and see my beautiful Molly in the cuddle clones eyes. I miss my cat Molly so much and this has brought me peace. Thank you!!!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Maria,04/01/2022,"I just received my clone babies, the job you guys do is amazing, however on my 2 clones faces I think it needed more yellow tone, it was made too white and reviewing the pictures I sent I don't see where all the white came from. I wish you guys can send pictures of the process, that way we can approve before gets shipped, in my case I would wanted more color on their face as the white makes them look a little different. Otherwise the body, tail, nose and ears you guys made such a great job.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When we first opened the package, my first thought was it doesn't look like her. But after just a short time, I came to realize the Cuddle Clone resembles her just enough. How the creator was able to include her perfect imperfections is amazing. She had a bump by her right ear that is on the clone. Her old lady neck ❤️ The way her legs laid just so, right next to me. I have had a few startling moments walking into my room, thinking it is Sarah laying on my bed. These are all good things. I think this company even sewed love into each stitch as they create this perfect masterpiece of my heart dog. I cannot thank them enough. Thank you, from Sarah's Oma",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jessika De Lair,02/06/2022," I ordered a custom plush of my mother's dog who recently passed away for Christmas. I paid the extra express shipping, paid over $300 CAD after the conversion... and the package got lost in the mail. The making of the plush already takes quite a while, so to go through the whole waiting process again... it was grueling. But February 6th, I finally got to give my mom her Christmas present! And she LOVED IT! I am also extremely impressed with the plush. The patterns are spot on, his fur feels so close to what it was: they even nailed the fluffiness of his tail! The eyes are a little weird admittedly, but it doesn't bother any of us. The body is phenomenal and he is SUCH a good cuddle buddy. He's very sturdy and somewhat bends so he's pretty ergonomic, so to speak. Overall, the only thing keeping me from giving 5 stars was the shipping process. We're both still very satisfied with the end result. Rest in peace Keanu, forever in our hearts (and now, arms) 🖤",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sarah King,02/01/2022,"We lost our beloved dog, Lucy, early January to cancer, she would have been 6 this month as well. We just received her Cuddle Clone today and we love it so much. When my toddler saw it for the first time she smiled, said “CeeCee” and gave it a kiss. Thank you so much!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Marisela Rivera,01/28/2022,I am so happy and excited with my clone! The level of detail with which they work is impressive. Thank you for perfectly recreating the most beautiful love I have. I had to say goodbye without wanting him to leave. Cuddle Clone gave me back the chance to kiss your big head every day! I love you all! Thank you for existing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
R.H.,01/27/2022,"They did amazing cloning my puppy Casey who passed away last year in April. Since I share a birthday with him I decided to get a clone so that I wont have to spend birthdays without him anymore. Thank you so much cuddle clones, thanks to you guys I can hug my puppy again. I absolutely love that the 3 on his side came out. That was one of my favorite things about him.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Latisha Taylor,01/26/2022,I lost my baby boy on New Year’s Day this year and it has been so extremely difficult. My boyfriend totally surprised me with a cuddle clone of my little fur son…I had no idea! I am so happy with the results. He’s in the exact same pose that my baby loved to do. Even the head tilt is spot on! Thank you so much!!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Adam Lallone,01/24/2022,So before Jesse James passed I ordered a Cuddle Clones of him to hopefully help me find some peace and closure in dealing with the time that he would no longer be by my side. Their customer service was genuine and heartfelt when I let them know that he would be passing soon and I feel like they made this clone a priority with so much heart. They did an amazing job capturing his spirit and essence as well as the details of his waterfall tail and the little bit of beige that came through his white coat as he aged. It will sit on his blanket with his favorite toy as a wonderful tribute to his memory. Thank you so much for the care and detail you put into him.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Roman Gollmer,01/24/2022,"In the past I was already thinking about having an cuddle clone of my loved dog. After he died beginning 2022 I immediately ordered my cuddle clone. The shipping to Germany was fast. It took only 2 weeks of producing and shipping to Germany. The result is insane, I’m so happy with it and I had tears in my eye as I unboxed the package. Thanks a lot!!! I highly recommend it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gretchen Brenner,01/21/2022,I was thrilled with Pepper 2. This was a gift for my daughter going away to college. The likeness is amazing and my daughter was thrilled. Almost as good as the real thing!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sacheen Ponte,01/21/2022,"Certain details are spot on, like my boy’s back and tongue markings. However his face is off. Had his eyes been spaced closer together and his nose bigger he would’ve looked much more like my little guy. Other reviewers had dead-on clones of their pets so I was a bit disappointed but happy to see the details that made him so unique like his patch of apricot fur on his back and that dark spot on his tongue. That fur on his back made me cry, it was so subtle but all his.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
S.R.,01/21/2022,"The clone was close. Needed adjustments to colouring, neck, ear shape and the nose needed to be larger. All round, pretty good. Would’ve loved to have updates with photos so that I could make one round of amendments through the process before sending. Too much of a hassle to send back. Nice memory of my recently passed dog. Gave the clone a big cuddle when it arrived.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sandra smolek,01/21/2022,Thank you to Cuddle Clones for doing such a great job on making this cute clone of my sweet girl.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Jody M.,01/19/2022,I got our Cuddle Clone Plush as a Christmas gift for my husband in memory of our sweet Saint Bernard we lost a year and a half ago. She is absolutely perfect. They even got her front paws crossed over each other just like how she would sit. We always loved it when she sat like that. Our Great Dane dog thought our Cuddle Clone Plush was a real dog and was sniffing it like crazy and trying to get it to move!! Our clone plush laid under our Christmas tree until we took it down as our sweet girl always slept under our tree every year. Many people thought the clone was a real dog and were surprised when it wasn't. My husband immediately knew it was our Lucy. My kids teared up as we have all been missing her terribly. I did buy a personalized dog collar to put on our clone plush with our dog's dates and name in the color orange just like her original collar. Thank you so much!! The best thing I have spent my money on.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Andre Burton,01/16/2022,"I was devastated to lose my baby boy, and needed some comfort.I love this. I put my boys t shirt and collar on it and after I take it to show people, he sits (protected from my other dogs) up on the shelf for me to look at. From the next room he looks so real! His face isn’t 100% exact, but from a short distance it is, and from the back, he’s fooled people! The quality of this is amazing, very well put together. Stiff and stays the way it’s made. An excellent tribute to my beloved boy. The tag on the bottom with his name is so precious. He isn’t a replacement for him, as there can’t be, but it’s nice to have. This isn’t a defect, but when you go to hug it, it will not feel like the real thing. As all pet owners who’ve lost their baby, you know there is no replacement; but it is a wonderful tribute. Thank you to those who put my Skeeter together. He’s beautiful",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sara Brown,01/14/2022,I ordered this Cuddle Clone for my 8 year old daughter for Christmas. The clone was of her German Shepherd. They are the best of friends and have grown up together. The quality and accuracy of our clone was amazing! My sister thought it was taxidermy because it was so realistic. It came looking just like our boy and I couldn’t be happier with the purchase!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Todd B.,01/13/2022,Wanted to make sure this video came through for review I just left ? Our dog thinks he has a twin.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Todd B.,01/13/2022,Had these two dogs made up for our two older kid’s dogs for Christmas. Got the awesome Christmas discount allowing us to be able to do this. This was almost the best personalized customer service I’ve ever gotten. Requests for more photos to get the clone looking best they could etc. We were assured they would get to us by Christmas and they kept promise . When package arrived my wife and I were almost scared to open it in case they didn’t match our dogs but were so ecstatic that they were such close matches. My kids were amazed Christmas Day and will always be one of their most precious gifts from us. Love this business!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mary Donoho,01/13/2022,My daughter turned 18 and she’ll be going off to college next year. Her dog Dixie is totally by her side every moment when she’s at home.

Robert Thompson,01/11/2022,"When our beloved Felix passed last year from health issues after 13 years as a part of our family, we were devastated. I had seen an ad for Cuddle Clones and it seemed a perfect tribute to purchase a hand crafted likeness of our awesome pet. I sent through the required photos available, as Felix had already passed, and awaited the finished product to arrive. The quality and accuracy of the finished \clone\"" was quite simply amazing",and left no doubt that we were looking at an incredible likeness of Felix,but more so,"it honestly felt like the \""spirit\"" of him had returned to us. Our entire family were in tears of joy",it was an amazingly rewarding experience. We feel like Felix has returned to us,and we are incredibly thankful to Cuddle Clones for this amazing gift.

My baby boy is back home. Thank you cuddle clones for your amazing job!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Keith Winfield,01/04/2022," Having made a clone of my wife's cat after he passed in an accident, I presented it as a Christmas present. However, as the cat left us so abruptly, we never really said goodbye. So imagine our surprise when we started walking around our house and he would be there... Alive and well and making us jump. (Turns out the kids were moving him) So beware. Your clone has a character, just like the real thing... On the product side of things. Head was a little big and very thick neck. But all the colours are exactly right and all the facial features are quite accurate. That said, would you really want an exact copy? That's more like taxidermy and my wife would have murdered me for having something so accurate as it borders in creepy! Lol",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A.,01/02/2022,"The cat that I got was cute, well-made, the colors were on point. However, the cat's head was 2-3 times bigger than a normal cat's and the eyes were kind of far apart. It looked like my late cat but the head looked weird. Overall, a good experience.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Christine C.,01/01/2022,"I ordered a cuddle clone of my rabbit, \Bunny\""",who passed away more than 20 years ago. She will always hold a special place in my heart. This company did such a fine job with her that when I hold her,she reminds me so much of my rabbit that I often cry. (They were able to do this without the benefit of digital pictures. All I could provide were pictures of old pictures.) I received her on Christmas Eve which made it even more special. It was weeks before I expected her to arrive.

Kathleen Walin,12/29/2021,"My dog Stupidus Maximus passed away suddenly and had heard of cuddle clones through Gone to the Snow Dogs YouTube channel. The wait is worth it! When I opened the package, I bawled due to how accurate it was even down to a small spot on an eye. Received this after a rough work day and couldn't have been better timing. They caught his essence so well that at times I question if this has moved. Will definitely get another one after the next dog once I'm ready for the next furry family member",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jacob Dilworth,12/29/2021,"The Clone is of my puppy (who's still around). I'm an aspie, so having her with me even if as a clone is immensely comforting. Actually, my own relatives can't tell the real deal from the clone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They got so many details just right! her fur patterns, her tongue that barely sticks out on the side, they even gave the fur the appearance of being double coated by making it grey on top & white underneath. It's amazing. I love it SO MUCH. Wendy is 14years old & has had a lot of health struggles lately, so this was an incredible gift. This is exactly how I want her to be remembered.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sean Brooks,12/27/2021," It took me a year after my best friend Tyson died that I decided to get a cuddle clone. It was also around the same time my cat Mittens died. My other cat Bristol became depressed after Mittens passed. This was part of my reason to move forward with getting Cuddle Clones! When they arrived and I held Mittens again I couldn’t help but cry. You guys did the most amazing job of capturing the essence of Tyson & Mittens. Mittens has been placed on the back of the couch where he always slept. Bristol was surprised & confused. She jumped up with a Mittens your back joy. She sniffed and nudged. She was confused….you look like Mittens, you’re in his spot but you don’t smell like him. Bristol now sleeps with Mittens every night like she use to do with her best friend. Tyson sleeps on top of my new dogs crate beside my bed. One of my other cats climbs up on top of the crate and cuddles into Tyson to sleep for the night. Thank you Cuddle Clones you’ve made my whole family very happy with the work you have done. My girlfriend also really enjoys her PJs with Tyson on one pair and Mittens on the other.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I love it and I love having something to hug when I'm missing him ♡",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Customer,12/27/2021,I recently lost my 10yr old rott/lab Tonka and it left such a hole. For Christmas my mom surprised me with a Cuddle Clone stuffed animal of him. I immediately started crying as soon as I saw it. I couldn't believe how perfectly it looked like him. All of those tiny details brought my Tonka back. It was truly one of the best gifts I could've ever gotten.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Danette Tolan,12/27/2021,"Our cuddle clone arrived on Christmas Eve! We were not expecting it until the middle of January. When we opened it up we were so impressed with how much alike it looked to our Australian Shepherd/Mini Sheltie Mix, Piper. They did an excellent job on her hair length, her coloring and even got the details of her eyes. Piper is about 6 different colors and they captured all of them. They even got her white “socks” on her feet correct. She is approximately the same size as Piper. The only thing we were disappointed in are the contours of her face. Overall, we give our doppelgänger 5 stars! Thank you so much!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jason Kautz,12/26/2021,When out of the corner of the eye.......our family keeps mistaking it for our dog. Better then we expected.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Shellie Stoglin,12/26/2021," I think my rating is more of a 3.5 star. My Cuddleclone is of my deceased childhood dog, Kapu, who passed away around Christmas of 2019. She was a very mixed dog, and I hoped this wouldn't be a problem for CC, since I suspected some of their plush patterns were pre-made for certain breeds or body types. I gathered as many photos of Kapu as I could for this process, and some angles were missing, so I knew not to expect perfection in some areas with the plush. However, the clone has random white patches on both flanks, which I'm not sure why were included since Kapu's pictures clearly show she didn't have those markings. I can only assume it was an attempt to blend the patterning? The structure of the face is also off--the eyes are too far apart, and the skull is a little too bulky, but the markings are correct. Otherwise, I love this replica, and I'm glad I bought this for myself as a Christmas gift. I will be keeping the plush, but I don't know if I'll spend this much money on another Cuddleclone. Love the concept, but the results seem to be hit or miss. Some positives: CC captured her brindle pattern very well, and I like how they included some of the more subtle brown hues to her fur. The legs, tail, and ears are bendable, which is very cute. The fabrics used are very soft and mimic the fur type she had in real life.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Lena M.,12/26/2021,"While the online ordering experience(UX) was great, the final product missed the mark. I sent in many photos of my pet but the coloring on his body and facial interpretstion isn't as accurate as I had hoped. The price point isn't cheap so I'm a bit disappointed as it was a Christmas gift for my son who dearly misses the dog that I had Cuddle-Cloned.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Jody ThompsonJernigan,12/24/2021,"I lost my Maggie in 2011. Had her for 13 years...she was my pound puppy. She was also the best dog I've ever had. Loving, protective, super smart. I've had other dogs and I love them.....but I'll never have another Maggie. My daughter got me a gift card for Cuddle Clones for Christmas. Oh my goodness....I had no idea how lifelike she would be. When I opened her....I cried for a long time, hugging and petting her. If you want one that looks and feels just like your pet....order from this company. They are phenomenal. They stayed in contact with me also as to where they were in the process with her. I love this company and their staff. They have made me a very happy old lady <3 Jody Jernigan",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thank you for recapturing my little princess. This purchase was so worth it! On top of the excellent quality, my clone was finished and sent to me so quickly. I received it on December 23rd, well before the due date, and to receive this just before Christmas it is the best gift I could ever ask for.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A.S.,12/23/2021,I would give this company 10 stars if I could wow the replica they did on my dog Wheezy was amazing I’m blown away. The attention to detail they did on him it’s like he’s home with us right now. I can’t thank this company enough for giving me back my furry Friend. I know his spirit has moved on but I get some sort of closure in having this stuff animal near like he’s always watching over me and that’s something you can’t put a price on. If you thinking about doing your own pet replica just do it I’m so glad I did. Thank you cuddle clones you brought my baby back home,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Laura Cook,12/23/2021,"Here's Beanie with her clone! They got her ears, short tail, markings, and color captured well.

Sean Bester,12/22/2021,"The customer service rep contacted me to ask additional details and get extra pics to help them with the designs. I am very happy with how both pups turned out, although my one complaint is that they didn't give Indy the super long tongue as requested. Still, my parents were happy with them and they now sit atop their fireplace with reindeer antlers on for Xmas.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Isaac Keene,12/19/2021," November 2020 my Paisley lost her fight against Kidney Cancer, and on her one year i wanted to do something special for her. I ordered the cuddle clone and it took about 3 weeks to arrive. The process was super simple yet incredible. Upon opening the package, I immediately broke because it was like i got to see her again in person. The creator did an incredible job with her looking identical. I couldn't have asked for a better Cuddle Clone of my Queen of Sass, Paisley.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tina Rockwood,12/17/2021,"My dog passed away November 18, 2021. I was having a hard time with it. I ordered a Cuddle Clone hoping it would a reasonable replica of my Gianni. When I received my Gianni Cuddle Clone I was absolutely blown away at how life like & close to My Gianni it is! All the way down to the little red bump above his right eye!! I have already ordered another one for my daughter of her dog Angel that passed in February. I cannot wait to get her!! I highly recommend Cuddle Clones! You won’t be sorry!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Diane LeBleu,12/16/2021,"We recently CuddleCloned our dog Lily and were very happy with the results. Our kitty Patches is our other treasure and frankly from looking at the cat clones, we were more cautious. We could not be happier with the results of our ‘Fatches’ as we call her (aka Fat Patches since she is a little heavier than Patches). We place her around the house and are often confused with which one is Patches and which is Fatches! Great work and great service!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stephanie Nash,12/16/2021,I had seen cuddle clones for awhile now and wanted to get them of both my dogs. The price was a little steep so I never got them unfortunately one of our pups had a brain tumor that was inoperable and had up to 6 months to live. He was my husband's bestfriend. He was heartbroken especially when we made the decision to put him at peace after the Condition worsened. It arrived prior to that while he was still active and got to take a photo side by side. I am amazed at how much they look alike. I had put him in the closet and forgot about him and he scared me when I walked in thinking it was the real dog. Details are amazing and the colors were spot on. My husband now has this beautiful memory to hold. I would definitely order from a cuddle clones again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Anonymous,12/16/2021,"We had our fur baby 14 years before he passed away of cancer. Cuddle clones did an outstanding job of making a Mr. Buddy replica. The color, markings, tail, everything is spot on. Will definitely be telling family & friends about cuddle clones.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rudy Aden,12/15/2021,I have autism and my cat went missing in 2020 so it hit me really hard she helped me in so many ways. So when I found out about Cuddle Clones I knew I had to make a purchase. I wasn't sure about it at first because with my autism I can be very particular about things and want them to be perfect. So I wasn't sure what to expect. I was thinking the worst. When I opened my package I was so surprised! I couldn't believe it. It was my girl! The fur was so silky like hers used to be and she was an exact match. This has helped me so much! Just having her back with me even if it's not physically. I couldn't be happier with my purchase. Thank you Cuddle Clones your team did an amazing job! I can't thank you enough how much this means to me. Would definitely buy from again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Kara Clairmont,12/14/2021,"I ordered a replica of my Bella Bunny who had passed away. I knew I would need it in order to continue on the healing process.

Thank you!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Skittles’ Mom,12/13/2021,"My son ordered this for me because he knows how much I miss my Skittles! So real looking! Her fur is spot on. I adopted Skittles when she was almost 3 years old and was blessed with her for 13 more years. Sweetest, funniest, most loving dog ever. We call this puppy Skittles because she’s a little smaller and looks how we believe Skittles looked at about 5 months old. Soooo cute! Made my year! Thank you to the artist and my son!!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Brenda Delorme,12/11/2021,"I had seen ads of Cuddle Clones and thought it was a sweet idea. When my boy Kona passed on Nov 10th I ordered a Cuddle clone of him on Nov 11th.

When I gave it to my daughter","she cried. She loves it! My daughter went through a \""drive thru\"" on her way back home. She had her CC sitting in the front sit and the person at the delivery window commented that she had a very pretty dog. She didn't realize it wasn't real. That's how amazingly realistic it looks.

LORRIE RUMPF,12/02/2021,I received my custom clone today and I’m 1000% satisfied. It looks just like my fur baby.

J.H.Z.,11/29/2021,"My wife and daughters went crazy and cried of happiness. We recently suddenly lost our 150 lbs Dog . His name was Oso . I ordered this and was gonna wait until Christmas but when I saw the plush , it was almost identical to my dog. I decided to give it to them right away They were in shock (they had no clue I ordered it. They didn't even know about Cuddle Clones) started jumping and crying . Really did an amazing Job.... definitely worth every single penny. Would strongly recommend. I m thinking on getting another plush for my mom of her beloved puffy who passed last year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Lesley B.,11/29/2021,"We received our Cuddle Clone yesterday and were very happy with the result. The color and markings were very accurate.

Warattaya S.,11/28/2021,"Our beloved bunny, Theodore, passed away unexpectedly in October 2021. We were devastated and could not cope with losing him so early. We were looking to find a memento of him and stumbled upon Cuddle Clones. We read some reviews and most of them were pretty good. There were not many bunny clones amongst the reviews, so we were a bit skeptical at first. We ultimately decided to try it out, anyway, since we really missed him. We ordered 4 Cuddle Clones of Theodore for our family members. We emailed them a few extra pictures for minor modification, and the customer service was very nice and helpful. We received our Cuddle Clones within 4 weeks even though we only paid for standard shipping. We were very happy that all 4 clones resemble our Theodore. They were not 100%, but most of the details that really distinguish Theodore from other rabbits were there. Thank you so much Cuddle Clones for giving us a piece of him back to us.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Amy B.,11/25/2021,"We ordered a cuddle clone when our older dog began showing more and more signs of balance and mental issues. While awaiting our order, she was diagnosed with a brain tumor leaving her completely unable to care for herself. We received the clone just three weeks after ordering, and on the Eve of when she was scheduled to be put to rest. The cuddle clone was almost perfect and came at the perfect time to help comfort my family. Thank you so much for a physical memoir of the best dog ever.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CherylS.,11/24/2021," Earlier this year we had to put my daughter's cat, her best friend, to sleep. She's been inconsolable for months and always says she wishes she could hold him again. I decided to splurge on a Cuddle Clone for her. He was a basic black cat so I wasn't sure if she'd understand that it was meant to be Ollie. However, as soon as he pulled him out of the package she yelled \IT'S OLLIE!!!\""",hugged him,"and started sobbing. Ollie had really strong facial features and sleepy looking eyes and Cuddle Clones nailed it. It's so lifelike it terrified our other cats! Our family can't thank Cuddle Clones enough -- they helped mend a whole in a little girl's heart and she'll cherish it forever.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mike Fortino,11/23/2021,"Our beloved dog of 19 years recently passed, and I found this company via google. I submitted photos, placed my order, and waited. You aren’t given any photo updates and have no idea how the final product will turn out, which made me nervous. However, upon receiving my ‘clone’ I am blown away. I never, ever write reviews but this was SO good I had to submit one. I’m talking, so good that it had my entire family in tears when I presented it to them. I’m talking so good, that I often am taken aback when I glance at it, having to then remind myself that my beloved is gone. It is SO worth it and I can’t thank this company enough for not only existing for us grieving families, but for the attention to detail they put in.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
audra ferguson,11/23/2021,I received mine in the mail today and was nearly brought to tears! my childhood dog recently had some health issues due to old age (shes almost 16!) and I decided I wanted to do this before her time comes. I was absolutely blown away by the attention to detail put into this stuffed animal. She looks almost exactly like my dog; I don't know how it could resemble her any closer! Thank you Cuddle Clones for making my day and bringing me comfort for when my girl's time comes. I am completely satisfied with my order❤️,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Robi Archibeque,11/22/2021,I appreciate all the work and effort they do to try to make them look so much alike but I think they really miss out on certain aspects of features Gretal‘s head is a lot smaller her color is darker this does not really look like my cat and I sent pictures but I appreciate the effort that they did to try to make it look like my cat I will love it and cherish it still End it will make me think of her when I travel since I can’t take her with me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Daniel Gamache,11/21/2021,Thank you so much for such a wonderful product. My wife was in tears when she received this as an early Christmas present from her sister.

Robin Quimby,11/21/2021,"I am very pleased. The color brindle the fluffiness, her smile, her eyes, tail is feathery like Tessie’s. Her chest white fur is just as Tessie’s chest was. She is soft and flexible. My sister and I were brought to tears when we opened package. Tessie died in June of 2021 and this clone is very comforting",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Brandy Nicholas,11/20/2021,"I was leery but so glad I decided to order this! We just lost our boy on Halloween night and so it’s a perfect reminder of our bestest good boy ever. Details are great, from his color and ears right down to the small scars he had on his side. The only thing wrong is his front legs could’ve been a little shorter but overall very happy with it! Thank you so much!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tahmara H.,11/18/2021,"I am completely satisfied with my cuddle clone of my baby boy, Bugger. I was so so worried that he wouldn't look right, but he is completely perfect. Except for his eyes. I put his eyes down as being peach, and he came to me with green eyes. But honestly, I don't care. In EVERY other aspect, he is 100% perfect. I left an additional comment saying that his ears were slightly taller than average, and they captured that perfectly. I've been sleeping with him ever since he came, and after a little bit of handling, his fur is so soft now. I got the little zipper pouch added so that I could store his old kitten collar inside. Bugger was hit by a car at just a couple of months over a year old, and only a couple of weeks after the 1 year anniversary of me bringing him home. I've wanted a cuddle clone of him since May, 8 months after he died, and I finally ordered one in October. I didn't pay for faster shipping, and he still came almost a full 4 weeks early. My only complaint is the incorrect eye color, but he is way more than perfect in every other way, and this review is more than deserving of 5 stars. I loved the tag having his name on it- a very unexpected surprise that makes him even more special!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Valerie Yamashita,11/16/2021,Saw Cuddle Clones on Instagram. I'm a small business owner and love to support other small businesses. Plus my 11 year old dog is like my third child. I don't have stuffed things of my other two kids but was looking forward to having one of Banzai. I was pleasantly surprised when I opened the package! The details especially of his fur coloring were impressive! Can't wait to see my kids' reactions when they see Banzai's Cuddle Clone on Christmas!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
John Stein,11/16/2021,"Let me just tell you, I was in tears when I received my cuddle clone! Tears of absolute joy! My baby left us a few years ago. After her passing, it's been exceptionally hard on my son and I. For Christmas, I decided to give Cuddle Clones a shot, for my 10 year old. After receiving our cuddle clone today, I'm seriously debating on keeping her for myself. But, I know my son will also feel the overwhelming joy! Thank you so much for bringing us back the best dog I've ever had!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Emily Smith,11/15/2021,"When I knew Aki, my sixteen-year-old calico, was sick, I immediately ordered a Cuddle Clone. I wanted to make sure I got it while she was still with me, and they delivered. They got her serious face down so well! I wish I had gotten a better picture of them together. What is really striking is how well they got her markings on her back, which are very specific, and the slight curl of her tail which she always had as an older cat. I have since had to say goodbye to Aki, which has been devastating to me, but I have the CC around to hold, and it's been so helpful in terms of healing. Thank you for capturing my angel girl.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Kai,11/15/2021,"I had to put my sixteen-year-old kitty, Sydney, down a few months back and I was absolutely devastated. Sydney had been my cherished companion since I was six, and I cannot remember life without her being there with me. I was a complete wreck for several weeks after her passing, and even though my feelings of grief have mostly subsided, they often return with a vengeance and I would become inconsolable. Right after her death, I started to look into purchasing a custom-made plush of her in hopes that it would alleviate some of the grief. I asked for her to be positioned in a sleeping position with her eyes closed and despite the fact that the artist normally doesn’t make the plushes in this pose, they delivered. When I first saw her, I nearly burst into tears. It was like she was with me again. So far, the plush has been exceptionally helpful in regards to my healing process. Whenever I have bouts of grief, I just hold her and those sharp feelings of emotional anguish slowly fade away. I’d like to end this review with a heartfelt “thank you” to the artist(s) who gave me my best friend back.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Emily Angeletti,11/12/2021,Overall I like it a lot tho I wish that they would of made his back feet a little longer since it was one of my requests. The fluffiness of his fur is perfect and the detail on the tail is on point. The first photo is actually flint.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I hoped the final product would provide enough similarities that I would notice a resemblance. But when I opened the package, I was overwhelmed. The likeness is spot-on down to the smallest details. I cannot properly express how excited I am. It also arrived two weeks earlier than advertised. I am beyond satisfied.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Megan Daughtrey,11/04/2021,"Looks so much like my best friend Thor who I lost this April. He's got a very detailed and unique coat and you guys got it all. Thank you to the artists who painted him. They got the dots and splotches on his snout and even his eyeliner. Got his legs colored right, ears match and the shape is perfect. Even the fur looks like his, I'm able to comb and style it like his fur laid. I highly recommend this product. Every pet parent needs one of these.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cody,11/04/2021,Lost my best friend less than a year ago and life hasn’t been the same. Today my fiancé walks in with a package and i was shocked to see my Keri staring back at me. The resemblance is amazing and my fiancé put her collar on the CC with a little tube of her ashes. The collar still smells like her and the CC looks so much like her I feel like I’m cuddling my baby again. Thank you thank you thank you! I’ve cried a lot since her passing and tonight I cried too but for the first time it was tears of happiness.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Marisa Ponzek,11/04/2021,"I purchased a cuddle clone as a memorial to my 15 yr old chihuahua after she passed away. I had planned on ordering one before she passed, so I had all of the necessary photos on my phone. The unboxing was an emotional rollercoaster, but it immensely helped me deal with the grief of losing her. I highly recommend. Standard Shipping was faster than expected.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Steven Gerard,11/03/2021,"My physical therapist owns a horse named Nigel. She FaceTimes me from the stable so I can visit with him. I love Nigel so much, I decided to have a Cuddle Clone made, so I can have my very own Nigel. It looks exactly like the real Nigel. I love it so much!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Richard DOYLE,11/01/2021,This product was great. I do not even want to call it a product because it really returns a friend. My son lost his rescue pup to a coyote attack last Christmas Eve an Cuddle Clones has returned a friend. We put our Cuddle Clone on the floor where our pup used to wait for my son. As soon as he saw it he scooped him up an tears of joy began to rain down. He ran to his room with the clone and just hugged it. I was so happy with the result. It couldn't be more perfect.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yui Ikeda,11/01/2021,I got this for my mother in law who lost her white pom suddenly and has been feeling so down. I put as many pictures as I can and described the details. Well they gave me a different white pemeranian😂 The face is too big for its body and look at that unbalanced face. But they did the back right so I’m giving 2 stars. At this point it was so funny that we decided to just put a picture on his face. Just be ready to laugh it off when it comes out like this!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Lauren A,10/31/2021,This was a birthday present for my girlfriend. It looks exactly like Barney and she absolutely loved it! Highly recommend!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Carol Rust,10/31/2021,This is my second Cuddle Clone! I love your company- they are so helpful and thoughtful.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tracy Coutu,10/31/2021,"I lost my Bentley in August. I saw the ad for cuddle Clone and thought it might help healing. It has a very good likeness. I put him in the window or on my bed, where my little guy used to love to be. It has a little more brindle than my guy and the shape of his face I'd a bit off but im.so pleased with my purchase. I love it!11",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Trish,10/30/2021,I lost my Siva back in August and my sister got me this cuddle clone. The first time she came it looked nothing like her so we sent it back and still extremely disappointed with the results and amount of money that was paid for this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
L.B.,10/30/2021,"I got my cuddle clones as a birthday gift from my love. Honestly it is the best present I've ever received. I have 8 dogs, but one is my daughter and to think one day she will leave me just is devastating. There's not a day that goes by that I don't want to see her sweet face and receive kisses. They absolutely captured her just perfectly. I mean a few things are a little off but they are pretty spot on to make a clone from pictures. Now I will always have her by my side. It's the best gift anyone could receive that is a pet lover. My dogs mean the world to me I just wish they could live a lot longer. Not only does this company help pet owners feel like they have their beloved pet back, but they also help pets in need and that is amazing to me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Diane LeBleu,10/29/2021,We are so pleased with our ‘Lily’ clone! Arrived in a very timely manner and we couldn’t be more happy with the outcome. Lily’s best pal is our kitty Patches (they have been together since they were babies) and even Patches was fooled! Cannot wait to see how our new clone of Patches turns out! Highly recommend!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Carly Frenzel,10/29/2021,Feels like I have my Harley is back in a sense. I would have given 5 stars but it was slightly off with to white of legs and to small of snout. But honestly very close made me tear up. Harley was my ESA I had him from 2 months old he was my birthday present for turning 13 and I had him till the day he died at 13.5. I was pleased that from ordering to receiving my clone took half as long as what they said would be. Shipping cost was a little ridiculous though for shipment to Canada costed me $77.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Thom Lange,10/29/2021,"I had to put my Dixie Stan down in June, after sixteen amazing years with him. The plush Cuddle Clone definitely captures his essence and his spirit! Great job! We love it, and while nothing can fill the hole his passing left in our hearts, his Cuddle Clone definitely reminds us of what a great little dog he was. Thank you!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Laura Mingo,10/29/2021,I have no words to describe how my heart felt when I opened the bag and saw my Pita Clone. She is perfect in every way and the detail is fantastic! I can also move her hair around like when she was sleeping or jumping or cuddly. This clone is a literal clone and I couldn’t be happier. Losing her was the worst thing to me and now I have my Pita Clone to hug and kiss. Thank you also for the excellent customer service.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Monica Bartlett,10/28/2021," During the ordering process, Cuddle Clones customer service was excellent. Very friendly and promptly answered all of my questions. My girl's clone is very well made and captures her 'spirit'. All of my descriptive comments were lovingly added. I had the interior pocket put in and have added one of those beating heart devices. Notice her paw on it's paw. I love it, but more importantly...SHE loves it! To the artists at CC - thank you!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sarah Whiteley,10/27/2021,"Loved my cuddle clone, I lost my girl 8 weeks ago and I purchased a cuddle clone of her, it arrived within a few weeks and I was blown away. I absolutely love it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cassie Wisener,10/27/2021,"I’m honestly not very please with my cuddle clone. It does not look as good as I thought it was going to. Maybe because it was a replica of a lizard instead of a dog. I’m not sure. This was a gift for my boyfriend because his gecko passed away, and I don’t really want to give it to him. But since I don’t really have time to have it remade or anything, I hope he likes it. :(",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Karen Rea,10/27/2021,I was amazed at the quality of workmanship and attention to detail I laughed and cried at the same time when I opened up my parcel Thanks to all the wonderful team to get my dog done so quickly and with a high level of likeness to the photos I sent My other dog has his best bud back ❤️,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Kevin Carey,10/26/2021,"My beloved aunt loves my little chihuahua mix so I went ahead and placed an order of my dog Pluto. The people at Cuddle Clones we’re so helpful and called during the order to make sure they got his likeness just right. It came perfect and just in time as she was going through some hardship and called to tell me how much Pluto cheered her up. I could barely understand her through all the crying, THANK YOU Cuddle Clones for making this happen and helping to heal our family. It means so much to us, thank you thank you 🙏🏼",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tasha Adams,10/26/2021,I was super excited but I must admit that it doesn’t look as close to my dog as I was hoping. They got his color wrong. They made him almost blonde when really he is a dark tan. They also made his head and snout much more boxey than they truly are. I still love it was just expecting something a little closer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Deborah Beaver,10/26/2021,"My cuddle clone arrived today. As I was taking it out of the package, Cocoa tried to play with it like it was a real dog. The artist that created this did a wonderful job. I am also including a picture of my Lucky dog that passed 2 years ago. I received this one a few weeks ago. I can't say enough good things",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MaryAnn,10/25/2021,Cuddle Clones did a fantastic job with Sylvie. It's a great remembrance of her and even fooled her sister Marble.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nancy M,10/25/2021,"I received my cuddle clone in today’s mail, and could not wait to open it. I was concerned that a cat’s facial features could not be captured as well as a dog’s. Also, the photos of Mitsy that I submitted were from different stages of her life. I am happy to say that I am absolutely thrilled with her! I can see her sweet little face in front of me. Her coloring is accurate, including the subtle grey striping of her tail. What really made me happy were the “thumbs” - Mitsy was a polydactyl, and so is her cuddle clone. My three kitties have been hovering around her, and seem confused! I am delighted with my purchase.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Karen Wirtz,10/25/2021,"I had you make my 2 Cavalier King Charles spaniels that have passed over the rainbow bridge. You did a wonderful job on both of them. I was skeptical but tried out Lucy first since she was mostly 1 color I thought she would be easier to do. She turned out so perfect I had you do Trixie and I can not believe how attention to all details and how close you came to my real dog. To anyone on the fence I would encourage you to to it. Provide as many details as possible because they are listened to. Thank you for giving me my babies back, if only as a stuffed animal.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
GERARDO GONZALO,10/24/2021,"I just want to tell you, that my Beto head cover arrived to my daughter house in miami It is really wonderful the work you do I really appreciate what you have done My daughter love it As I live and play in Venezuela , I will have to wait until my wife comes back to Venezuela and bring it to me In than moment ( Mid November) I will take a picture with Beto and the head cover and I promise to send it to you By now I just have the pictures that my daughter sent me, and I really love it Thank you very much for such a Wonderfull job. You just made me and my family very happy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sarah,10/24/2021,We received our CC this evening and we were all taken back emotionally. We lost our boy Charles just before Christmas last year and we haven't been the same since. Everyday we miss him and our Cuddle Clone was an amazing way to bring a piece of him back to us. I cannot believe how well the artists did on his brindle fur and gentle face. They capture everything more perfect than I expected and I could not be happier. My children haven't stopped hugging him and it has brought us so much joy! I cannot tell you how grateful we are for the love and care put into making Charles likeness in our Cuddle Clone. This was a beautiful tribute to our beloved family member. Thankyou so much Cluddle Clones!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Felix Low,10/23/2021,"After looking at other pictures reviews I decided to submit pictures of my departed pup. Was on the fence as I wasn't able to provide all the pictures that were requested but when I opened up the package I was completely floored by the detail and resemblance of one of my best friends!! Seeing the end results made me realize I made the right call! Thank you so much cuddle clones, I'm making sure to make recommendations to others in regards to your products!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Clement Tim,10/22/2021,"It's hard to believe how stunningly accurate this is. I would never have thought it possible. Not only does it look like our beloved Sammie, it somehow seems to reflect the same attitude. (Ok, perhaps I'm projecting.) But wow, just WOW!!!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Kyle Byers,10/21/2021,"I am writing this review to let everyone know that Cuddle Clones stands by their work. I am sure that the majority of their orders are satisfactorily filled upon initial order. Unfortunately, when I received my golf head covers, the color was not correct. Per customer service, I returned them and they were re-made to my satisfaction. Not only do we love them, we receive compliments almost every round.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jillian Marschall,10/21/2021,"My beloved Pomeranian, Baley, passed away 6 months ago, in April 2021. To honor her memory and also still have her here with me in some way, I got Cuddle Clones of her. Baley had two distinct looks, one with her full coat and one where she was shaved. Baley loved being shaved, especially in the summer when it’s very hot! (I live in Arizona) So I ordered two Cuddle Clones, one of her with her full coat and one of her shaved. They arrived on October 12, right before Baley’s birthday on October 15. I waited until her birthday to open them. When I did, I cried! They look so much like her! Even down to her markings and spots and her fluffy tail! Even her facial expressions almost match the pictures I provided! I know that must be hard to try and make it look real on a stuffed animal’s face. Pomeranians are small dogs, but I wanted something I could hold so I had also requested for them to be a bit bigger than the normal 12” size since these were for an adult. I requested 16-18 inches. They are the perfect size! They are practically the same size Baley was and they both fit in my arms so snugly, like I am holding her again. I am very happy with my Cuddle Clones! Here is a picture of the finished Cuddle Clones along with the original picture I sent for each version. Thank you so much! (And please thank the artist who created my Cuddle Clones! She/He did a superb job!)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
C.,10/21/2021," I am happy to have something that resembles my baby, who just passed away recently. However I wouldn’t say it’s a “clone”. The face looks more like a dog, specifically the snout shape (seems more “smoosh face” than narrow like a cat) and ears (my cat had good sized ears but they seem a bit oversized); both of these things causing a resemblance more like a Frenchie dog than my cat - see pics. I am also disappointed that the whiskers are just clear fishing line type material and not white like my cat’s (I did mention “white whiskers” in my order notes but I’m assuming that’s just not something they can do). They color of his fur was pretty easy and looks good, along with the eye color. You can see the stitching behind one of the ears if you gently fold it back, which isn’t a major issue as it stays hidden normally, but again just spoke to the overall quality to me.  Lastly I expected the paws to have actual individual toes, but the “toes” are just simulated using some stitching, and the paw pads underneath are literally just stamped on paint. It’s cute and it gives me some comfort but for the price and promise of a “clone”, I expected something better both in terms of quality and overall resemblance to my pet.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Carol Madonna,10/18/2021,Got this clone made of my son's dog as a wedding gift so his fur baby could be there in spirit. No pets allowed at the venue. The bride and groom loved it! The clone looked so similar to the real dog it was uncanny! Your company did a fantastic job. I ordered the largest size of the cuddle clone and was very happy with the final results!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Jessica Landeros,10/15/2021," My baby of 19 years, Aisha, passed away on Labor Day. Although I had 19 wonderful years with her, my heart was still not ready. We thought about getting a Cuddle Clone and finally submitted the pictures. After I submitted the order, I received a request of one more picture, and any details that I thought should be included. They captured it all: The spot on her nose, the way her paws lined up when she was lying down, and even her tender little belly. I figured it would be a good representation at best, but they picked up on all the coloring, her Tabby markings, and even the \rings\"" on her tail. Having this gift to hug and touch is letting us know that we will never forget the feelings she brought us while she was with us. Some people see a stuffed cat or dog","and at least one person at Cuddle Clones understood that we see a precious soul that we were fortunate enough to share our lives with. Thank you so very much for the incredible work. My heart is full of gratitude.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Eibhlín Seoighthe,10/15/2021,Absolutely delighted with our Clone of our beautiful boy Pippin. We lost him just at the beginning of fall and our toddler has been missing him terribly.

I took her with me to pick up the kids from school and they couldn’t believe there eyes. It was like they got to have their dog back.

Belinda Baysinger,10/10/2021,"Overall, they did a great job. It looks like my Roman and is going to give me something of him for years. In a perfect world, I would have been much more satisfied if his merle markings were the reddish auburn brown they actually are rather than the chocolate on the stuffed dog. I sent in photos with him in natural light in the yard, he is light red with deep red merle markings. His tan points on his face and legs are PERFECT. His nose spot is PERFECT. If I could go back I would draw attention that his markings are deep auburn brownish red rather than a chocolate brown, it would have meant much more to me if they were. But overall they did a good job, and I highly recommend them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sarah O'Brien,10/09/2021,"Wanted to thank you all for this wonderful present. We put our dog down at the end of May and he was my husband's dog (had him since before we were married) and he was an AMAZING dog!! I found your site after trying to find that perfect reminder for my husband of our dog. When I put in the order, for my husband's birthday, I was so nervous to see what he would look like when we received the clone. We received the clone in the mail and I was amazed. I just couldn't wait to give it to my husband so I gave it to him today :) The minute he saw it, he cried.....he was truly shocked how much it looks like our dog Elvis. THANK YOU!!! We had to put our 2nd dog down in mid-June (just a few weeks after Elvis) and now that we have received our clone...we will be ordering one for our kids of our other dog. THANK YOU again!! Love it!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Marissa Swart,10/09/2021,Losing Tiny was tough. He didn’t have much time with us and quickly stole our hearts. I am truly thankful for how fast they made our keepsake Tiny.

Danielle Palumbo,10/02/2021,We recently lost our dog in June and I decided to have a cuddle clone made of him. It looks just like our dog. We literally cried when we opened the package. They even included details that I did not specifically request. I did have to submit it for a remake because the first ones fur color was too red/brown but the remake is 1000% perfect. I was nervous about the remake process but you get the exact same clone just with your changes made. I would highly recommend getting a clone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tamara White,10/02/2021,"We lost our beloved cat Nani a year ago. As a family we've struggled with her loss, but not as hard as our 6 year old son. He lost his best friend and a year later he still cries for her. We got our cuddle clones in the mail today and we were reduced to tears the second the bag was open. A calico is not easy to recreate and the artists had EVERY patch exactly right. Every detail was respectfully and carefully crafted to bring the comfort and vision of our Nani back to our little boy. He loves his cuddle clone and it's brought him such comfort in such a confusing time for a child. Thank you cuddle clones for making my baby smile and giving our family some closure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Joanna Clarke,10/01/2021,"It’s actually quite hard to find the words to describe how it felt unwrapping my Cuddle Clone of Dudley and feeling like I was looking him in the eye. I actually cried - for quite a long time! The likeness is extraordinary- how the makers captured his essence so expertly I will never know. It is a phenomenal talent and I am utterly delighted. But it isn’t just how amazing Dudley looks. The customer service from Cuddle Clones is beyond compare. From start to finish I have felt like a treasured customer. Nothing has been too much trouble, I received regular updates and Dudley arrived weeks earlier than expected. If every business had such outstanding service the world would be a happier place. Thank you to all of you Cuddle Clones! You can count on my future business 😊",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tyler Whitcomb,09/20/2021,"I took a chance on ordering a golf club head cover, and it seemed a little pricey. However, after I received it, I love it more and more everyday. Worth every penny.

I don't have to feed it or clean up the slobber! : )",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Abigail Thomas,09/18/2021,"I received my cuddle clone of my late girl Granger a few days ago and have waited to review while I mulled over my feelings on the clone. I'm genuinely impressed by the airbrushing work on the body; while a touch too light in shades (mostly grey and beige instead of black and brown in color), the \texture\"" and appearance is honestly pretty spot on. The pattern of her fur is so nicely and accurately replicated. The real issue for me is in some of the smaller details. The ombre on the face isn't really right",the inside of the ears are the wrong color,there was some odd extra fur on her ears that wasn't on her in real life,and the tail's too long. Overall,I feel like this clone is about a 6/10 in terms of how much it physically represents my girl. I may make some adjustments myself that get it closer to a 7-8/10,which I have decided is a reasonable amount in terms of looking as close to my cat as a stuffed animal can really manage. I feel like not as much attention as could have been given was given to my clone in the production process,but I also think it's an amazing job for what's been done and I'm genuinely impressed and thankful. Having a tribute to my baby that I can see and touch has been such a milestone in my recovery from her loss; it's so comforting to have something of her that can offer physical and visual comfort. It helps fill some of the void that her unexpected and painful absence has left in my home. ❤️ I'm genuinely happy to have my clone,little differences and all,"and will probably be willing to order again in the future when the time comes for my other fur babies.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Melanie Kilsby,09/18/2021,I had my cuddle clone delivered today of my dearly loved bagpuss who passed away just before Christmas.

I was kept up to date with how the making of her was going and will be ordering other products,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Todd Vandeberg,09/15/2021," Hello to all employees at Cuddle Clones, I would like to extend a huge thank you for all of you as you did an excellent job on creating a close replicate of our late Maxy Max. I know that we had some issues that needed to be fixed, but you did a great job on those fixes and he looks like the Max that we remembered. We will make sure to let people know the excellent job that you did to create the stuffed animal that we asked for. We will cherish this forever. The staff was very helpful in letting us know the status of the product being made and shipped. Its been a hard 3 months since he passed and this will help in our grieving process and hope to get through this a lot easier. Thank you so much for the best product.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
April Haas,09/15/2021," You did a great job recreating Maja, even capturing her eyes perfectly. Her upside down heart on her behind is exact. Maja loves it too but of course she can't play with it. I had to hide it up on a high shelf. Everyone that sees the video thinks it's two dogs and love the concept. I had two chihuahuas that passed before I got Maja at 17 and 14 and I am saving to have them made up as well. Good thing I took a lot of pictures of them. Thanks again for the good job.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Vicki Wadsworth,09/14/2021,"I couldn’t be more pleased with the timeliness of the order, the quality of the product and the resemblance to my pup. Well Done! I’ll definitely be recommending this to all my golf friends",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sev Nelson,09/14/2021,"Super cute amazing and adorable her Fur is a little more red but Suzie loves it but also scared of it little larger than she actually is but it’s perfect. Also got it a lot earlier than it was supposed to come, didn’t even pay for earlier timing! Great great great!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Julianne Barclay,09/13/2021,I can not tell you how happy I am with my cuddle clone. The likeness to my beautiful pooch is amazing. Literally worth every penny. I love her so so much. Thank you cuddle clones!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Roger Best,09/13/2021,You guys did a excellent job on my male shih tzu .We really like it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Linda Nugent,09/13/2021,I absolutely love my cuddle clone! The markings are spot on! Thank you so much!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Shelley.breedlove,09/11/2021,"The detail and attention that went into the creation of this clone was so much more than I anticipated. They not only matched the crossed paws of her front legs (which I asked for in special instructions), but the wonky angle of her back legs, and the stumpiness of her tail, which was partially amputated when she was younger. Our girl has osteosarcoma and is not long for this world, so I took a chance on having this clone created, hoping it would do her justice and help preserve a small element of this dog we love so very much. I am so glad I ordered! Thank you, Cuddle Clones, for the effort and attention you obviously put into every order.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Debbie Hemschoot,09/09/2021,"I lost my gorgeous 15 1/2 yr old yellow labrador,Madison, just over a month ago. I had considered in the past ordering a cuddle clone, but wasn’t sure if they could truly capture what a beautiful girl she was. Well when I received my cuddle clone, I was thrilled with the beautiful replica I received. At a first glance, you would think you were looking at a real dog. Thou I have felt her presence since her passing, coming home and seeing your product sitting on my couch is heartwarming and has made me so happy that I ordered from you. Highly recommend cuddle clones.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Larry Grey,09/08/2021," We experience the heartbreaking loss of our fur baby Ari. His Daddy found Cuddle Clones and requested them to make a replica of Ari with a tummy pouch for his ashes. The first version wasn't quite right and the recreated Ari. Attention to detail was great and he now travels with us when we leave the house. We miss our fur baby Ari and are glad to carry his ashes with us in his clone. Thank you for all your attention to detail,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rachel Bruno,09/08/2021,I cannot thank this company enough for creating my baby into the perfect cuddle clone. I lost my 15yr old boxer in July and it has been so heartbreaking she is my child. This clone came and put such a smile back on my face and my husbands face. We miss her everyday but with our cuddle clone we get to have a piece of her with us at all time. I got the belly pocket and I keep her hair and a lil of her ashes in there so she can continue going on adventures with her mommy and daddy❤️. Thank u so much for creating such a perfect priceless gift to us. It truly means the world to us and is helping on the healing journey💜💎,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Meagan Curiale,09/08/2021," My cuddle clone is exactly what I pictured and needed. Loosing your pet in a very indescribably feeling and the grief hits people completly differently. The lack of seeing my beautiful baby was heart wrenching. The cuddle clone helped fill the void and bring peace back that she will always physically exisit in a way. The cuddle clone also has helped. But if the sadness that my youngest child won’t remember home, I am hoping this cuddle clone will help that and keep her alive in him as well. The cuddle clone also helped my daughter. She know has something to hug and lay with. Our beautiful baby Pixie went to heaven snd now we have “the pixie dog” to always cherish and remember her by. The only recommendation I tell my friends to consider is getting the clone prior to your pets passing. In the beginning of receiving the pet it played tricks on our eyes/hearts when we would see the pet in the corner of our eye. The detail the maker used with every picture, price of hair was incredible. My dog (as pictured) had a mix of gray a black and white since she was a pup. I thought it would be hard to mimick. Also, being a control freak i am customer service was unbelievable. Answered every question and email in such a friendly quick matter P.s I had also did a lot of research before purchasing this pet. I do not know why anyone would write a bad review. Even their “bad” pictures I would be satisfied with. Of course you are not going to receive your exact animal. However, I am not sure how they could come any closer than what I received. 10 star review.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Kat,09/08/2021,"When he arrived, i realized it was a stuffed toy just before I tore it open and paused and cried a little, as I realized what it was. I then prepared...it will look nothing like him, he'll look goofy...don't get your hopes up.....and then I tore it open with a deep breath. And then I cried! It was like he was looking at me. He looks so real, the other dog began to act up wanting to sniff and interact with him. He is not perfect. The white isn't perfect. The head is a bit fatter then he was (They used a pit bull as shape, but he was an English Staffordshire, their head is less bulky and less round....but really..who cares! My boy is home.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ed Whited,09/07/2021,"I want to thank Cuddle Clones for an amazing Beagle replica of Angus! The wows,and laughs have been non stop since posting on social media,and I'm sure will continue on the golf course. The Angus name for my Beagle,hat logo and finizhing touch,golf head cover is a happy memorial reminder,dedicated to best friend, mentor, my father who died 3yrs ago. I will definitely recommend u to my pet friends & golfers,and knowing it's also for a worthy cause makes it even more worthwhile. Looking forward to my next Cuddle Clones purchase.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sandi de Leon,08/31/2021,"Our beloved dog Tucker died about five weeks before my husband’s birthday, just shy of fourteen years old. We had him for 12 1/2 of those years. I wanted to give my husband something to remind him (not really needed, of course) of our good buddy. I hadn’t expected this to arrive prior to my husband’s special day as the delivery wasn’t expected for about eight weeks. I was so surprised and thrilled when it delivered a week before his birthday. The resemblance to Tucker is remarkable. We had him sitting on our bed when we had company over to celebrate my husband’s birthday. Each time we passed the open door, we were startled for several seconds seeing “Tucker” on our bed, wondering why he was on it since he never did get up on the bed. The customer service for Cuddle Clones was remarkable; I received answers quickly and professionally. I couldn’t be happier. Of course there are slight differences in the finished product and I have seen some complaints from other customers, but there are none from us! The artists did an amazing job and I would highly recommended anyone wanting to purchase to do so. We have been having so much fun “staging” him in his former favorite positions throughout the house that it really helps lessen the pain of losing him. Thank you so much!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cas Simmons,08/31/2021,"I ordered a Cuddle Clone of my dog, Dakota, a day before leaving for college. I just received it today and not only did it come faster than it was supposed to, it’s also beautiful and so well-made. I miss Dakota so much and I burst into tears opening the package. This will definitely make college a little easier❤️ Thank you Cuddle Clones!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ashlee Bearham,08/30/2021,I'm so happy my order arrived on time. The clone reminds me so much of my cat. The colours are perfectly matched for both the eyes and fur.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tom Caulley,08/26/2021,"The cuddle Clone of our dearly departed Pumpin Seed sits guard beside the door of our senior-living apartment. She is so lifelike that everyone has had to comment. Some think we too her body to a taxidermist and had her stuffed. Some neighbor's dogs have to stop and sniff her to see if she is real. Needless to say, she has been the center of many conversations here in our little community.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Juliette B.,08/24/2021," I am so impressed by the replica of my beloved Herbie-cat, who passed away too soon from cancer, about 8 months ago. He arrived much faster than expected - just under a month from date of order, withough rush shipping! It's obvious that the makers studied the photos I sent & listened to my comments & requests. Of course nothing can be 100% like the original, but so many details are captured - more than I asked for - even his little white tufts of ear-floof are there! His face and body is a very good duplication his unique orange tabby markings - again it's really clear that a lot of thought & care went into creating him. His color isn't 100% accurate, but I think that's mostly due to the airbursh technique necessary to put tabby markings on an over 50% white-furred kitty - the paint dosn't penetrate all the way through the layers of fur, so its a bit light in some spots, and the edges between orange & white aren't as crisp as in reality, but more blurred. Just part of his charm, and only noticeable up close - from a distance the whole familiy keeps doing double-takes - it's like he's back with us, he's so accurate! Our other cat, who was very close with, him was quite taken aback & not quite sure what to think of him - she clearly recognized it was her absent friend! The picture next to my phone is almost immediately after opening him, the two by the computer monitor is after brushing him & squeezing him back into shape - his face & neck were a little flattened from shipping (I was surpised that he arrived in a plastic mailing envelope & not a cardboard box!). We always said with his big eyes & fluffy cheeks he was as cute as a living stuffed animal, and now we have the proof! I'm so glad of the option to add the pouch in his tummy, I have some of his fur I saved from brushings, and I plan to install a recordable voice box in it - Herbie was a VERY talkative kitty, and I have several recordings on my phone of his 'Herble-burbles' that I will put on it. Suggestions - I wish his tail had wire in it so I could pose it more easily. Possibly also his ears - so much of a cat's expression is in their ears (I may try to add that myself, to thread some jewelry wire between the layers of fabric in his ears). Also, another feature that I would have paid extra for would be if he could have come with a recordable voice box pre-installed, and the button to activate it in a paw. The one I plan to purchase has a button on a wire, designed to be threaded into a stuffy's limb, but I'm not sure if I'm brave enough to try making a hole in his pouch lining & threading it into a leg or not.... We'll see! Overall my Herbie-clone definitely exceeds expectations - even down to his name embriodered on his cloth tag - when I was a little girl I loved when stuffed animals came with names on tags like that! Thank you for giving us back a little bit of our precious buddy!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Taron O.,08/24/2021,I was so devastated when my girl Lie’la passed away. She was 3 years old. I see Cuddle Clones on Facebook and I knew I wanted to get one made of her. Lie’la was a Sphynx (hairless cat). She wasn’t totally bald she had fuzz that felt like a peach and it felt velvety. One of the Main things I wanted them to concentrate on was the mark on her upper lip. The hit every mark from the lip to the peach fuzz fur and the wrinkles she had. I am so happy and they did an amazing job on her.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Kaitlin McKenna,08/23/2021,"After the passing of my best friend, I came across cuddle clones and I impulsively bought, not sure if it was going to turn out good.

Elizabeth DeGreeff,08/21/2021,"When our sweet Bella passed away, it was somewhat sudden and heartbreaking. Cuddle Clones immediately came to my mind as one of the most unique ways to commemorate her. I was very nervous to order, especially for the price, but I was blown away with how closely the CC team was able to replicate Bella’s features. My mom LOVED her and was so excited to somewhat be able to keep her around. If you’re on the fence, I recommend trusting them with your pet! You will not regret it!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Vinessa Giacchetti,08/20/2021,I can’t express how happy I am with my clone my dog passed away a few weeks ago unexpectedly… and we were all distraught ..

Thank you so much !!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Alyssa Rand,08/20/2021,"Honestly, this stuffed clone might be TOO realistic.

Carmella Perrucci,08/16/2021,"I recently lost my sweet pup I have had for 15 years. She was with me for half of my life and I couldn't love her more.

They got all of her little spots perfectly, her little grey face. Everything. So beyond happy and definitely recommend.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

God bless you. Nadia.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Customer,08/14/2021,It is perfect it looks like what it is a stuffy clone. And now my daughter can cuddle her best friend/ paw sister. it has been hard on us losing her but this is a good way to horror her and that fact that this also helps other animals is even more important as my paw baby came from a shelter aswel. Thank you so much to the whole team my your god bless you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Diane Rutledge,08/13/2021,"I just got my Cuddle Clone today, and I am so happy with your plush! She looks so much like my Poppy, who passed away a couple of years ago.

Thank you for your expertise in getting Poppy's essence! The pic in the middle is Poppy and one on right is the plush!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Jenell J.,08/12/2021,"I recently received my cuddle clone of my sweet cat that was taken from me in May (2021). I didn't have much time with him and didn't have many pictures to offer, but the artists did an amazing job at re-creating him in plush form!

Autumn Rachui,08/12/2021,"Absolutely in love with my plush!!! I’m headed to college so I wanted a plush of my childhood dog and current baby, Flea, to take with me. I was nervous to spend so much on a clone because I wasn’t sure they could really make it look like my dog. But Cuddle Clones totally exceeded my expectations! I had tons of requests and they fulfilled all of them with amazing customer service! The expression, body shape, and even toenails are spot on. My only critique is that I wish her fur was darker like my real dog's, but the airbrush job is still very impressive for being on such a white, furry canvas! The plush is very high quality and feels super durable with firm stuffing, wired legs, and quality fur. I even got my order 4 WEEKS earlier than I expected. My pictures don’t do this girl justice! If you’re worried like I was about buying one, just do it!!! It is so completely worth it!!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Lisa Ramos-Moya,08/11/2021,"When our 13 year old blue heeler, Dodger past away 7/14/21 we were devastated.

We ordered it the next day and you had \""him\"" at our doorstep 3 1/2 weeks later! We love it so much! I love having him in the house again and his two little fur brothers go up to him every morning waging their tails and saying good morning to him like they did every morning for over 10 years. Thank you so much for the amazing service",the constant contact during production and even a few emails to me,"making sure you got his personality and traits just right.

Candice St-Denis,08/10/2021,"My Cuddle Clone arrived much sooner then expected as I didn't request a rush, roughly three and a half weeks, and as such I was a little concerned to open it. But it was done wonderfully, the attention to details and requests I made were done to perfection. They even gave it a little kinked tail like I requested. My cat had a lot of markings and they did a fantastic job colouring her, even down to her toe beans. Yes it was expensive, being in Canada it was a little more then I expected, especially the charges for border fees. But I do not regret my purchase. It's perfect and I'm happy to have her. Will order more in the future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dawn Peterson,08/09/2021,We lost our sweet precious puggle pj 1 month ago. I miss him so much my heart aches. Ordered the cuddle clone for comfort.

Hollis Harris,08/04/2021,I spent 9 days in the hospital and had my cuddle clone of my beloved cat with me. It was the talk of the hospital and doctors were taking photos and telling their spouses about the site. My anesthesiologist even came back to see me just to talk about the clones. The nurses were the same and so many people thought it was a real cat at first. I would imagine you got at least a dozen orders from Ohio.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Michael Cifuentes,07/31/2021,"Words cannot express my gratitude of how accurate this replica of my beloved Cali looks. Cali’s fur was very unique and distinct compared to your average calico although I’m sure every pet owner would say the same about their pet. Aside from the hind legs which are twisted at the end, I think that’s because of the pictures that I sent them although I’m not really sure at this time I’ll have to look back at it again at some point I am very happy overall with the amount of detail. This looks like my cat that unfortunately passed away three weeks ago. Thank you cuddle clones the delivery was quicker than I expected. I can tell you put a lot of hard work into this and I can only imagine that this was not an easy task I thank you from the bottom of my heart this cat was my world for 10 years and thanks to you I will have something to hold onto. I am grateful and I will definitely buy another version of Cali when I have the money for it thank you again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I decided to have a cuddle clone made in her likeness and I received it just a few days ago. Oh my goodness, it took my breath away! My cuddle clone looks just like my Ruby! It comforts me so much to hug her and have her little clone near to me in bed. My advice to others is to order one of these, but give lots of photos of your pet from all angles and tell about any special features that are important to replicate. They did this for me and I am so thrilled to have my Ruby clone. She is so precious to me. ❤️",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The same night she found this website, after reading the reviews and looking at the kinds of animals and way you can make them, I knew I had to get one! It took a few weeks but it was worth the wait! It even had her wired hair and her little hair on the top of her head that we called her Mohawk! She loved it and try to cuddle with it as much as she can without our dog with have now getting to it lol! Thank you cuddle clones for bringing our puppy back!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Noorhi Perez,06/18/2021," Before ordering our cuddle clone for our cat, we already skimmed through the reviews made by other owners here. We noticed that in contrast to dogs, the facial features of cats were not as accurately constructed. However, since we own both a dog and a cat, we understand that cats tend to have a wide range of physical appearances unlike dogs, whether they are crossbred or not. During the ordering process, we could only provide a maximum of 6-8 different angles of our pet, so that the designers can get the most accurate grasp of what your clone should look like (abstract-wise). Furthermore, the lighting, resolution, and the fact that many owners may not have a multitude of different photos of their cat, all greatly affect how the designer interprets the color, dimensions, and the facial features of the cat. This is in part due to the fact that the nose and muzzle on cats are quite small, making it difficult to mold its shape. So, when the designers finalize the face by stuffing and sewing it, it may slightly distort the clone's face. Because we understood this, we were already happy if our cat clone had an overall resemblance of approximately 70%. Including the shipping, foreign exchange rate, and import duty taxes, our order cost us approximately $360 (CAD) in total and we received our package a month later. For a custom stuffed clone of your unique pet, this is a completely reasonable cost. Fortunately, we were very happy when we unboxed our cuddle clone and we felt that it had an 80% resemblance to our cat. As expected, the facial features of the clone were still a bit off, which you can see in the photo below. We were so grateful that our precious dog thought that her feline companion had finally returned home. We recommend that you mention what color the whiskers and eyebrows on your clone ought to be, since we received white ones, which we were able to re-color using sharpie. The material used to make the whiskers are incredibly limp unlike that of a real cat's, which is one suggestion that we would like the company to be aware of in the future. We were happy that the designers followed our special characteristic request to make our sitting clone at our specified height of the cat and length of its tail. The delicate use of the airbrush created a nice color coating on my clone, giving it the realistic appearance of the undercoat of a real cat. Thank you to everyone at cuddle clones for helping us to reunite with our beloved pet.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hailey Santibanez,06/18/2021,I got this for a first Father’s Day gift for my boyfriend and I’m so glad it turned out so good with all her little details. He loves it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Kasie LaCrone,06/17/2021,"I ordered a plush clone for my boyfriend for his first Father's Day as we are expecting a baby boy in September. Rooney, our Frenchie, will forever be our first born son and I wanted to clone him as our human son's first stuffed animal and give it to my boyfriend for his first Father's Day. Cuddle Clones as a company was great to work with and I really love their charitable stance. Knowing that we helped donate to animals makes the price okay but I will say I wasn't 100% in love with the product. The fur isn't very soft at all and the resemblance is vague at best. Maybe I'm being too picky or expecting too much but I would give this a 7/10. I get that they only used photos to create the clone but I was still hoping for better quality all around.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Amanda,06/17/2021,"I lost my older dog Esme, a Bichon Frise to kidney disease last year and I miss her terribly. I decided to splurge on getting a cuddle clone made of her and I'm so glad I did--they got the details right. It's like Esme has come back in plush form.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Kim Bulloch Eklund,06/17/2021,"I cannot get over how perfect my Cuddle Clone of Princess turned out! There was so much attention to detail from her pink nose to her crazy fluffy tail, to her head tilt. Even her fur color is exactly what she looked like including her white wing patches she had on her back. There's already been a few times when I leave the room and come back and I see it out of the corner of my eye and I think it really is Princess. It's like she's still here with us. Thank you so much for all the attention to detail that was put into making her. It is a great tribute to my sweet Princess.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Melissa Dominguez,06/17/2021,Our sweet Oliver got very sick over a few hours this past Christmas Eve. My Parent's brought him to the emergency vet and they had to make the decision to put him down. Losing him was so unexpected and left us heart broken. We wanted to surprise my Parents so we had ordered a Cuddle Clone for part of my their Mother's Day and Father's Day gift. We all waited to get together to watch them open it. We were ABSOLUTELY AMAZED!! We were all brought to tears. You captured our beloved Oliver ❤ Thank you so very much for your beautiful work and dedication to details!! We ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT!!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Justin Preyer,06/15/2021,"I was so excited to get my cuddle clone of my cat Jax today after some delivery delays. Jax passed away a little over a month ago and I wanted this as a comfort/memorial gift for my husband. Unfortunately, for almost $300 it wasn't up to par. The fur is rough, and not something I would want to cuddle. Additionally it looks and feels matted in some places, and it sheds. The likeness is alright. They made him a little skinnier than he was in real life, and the hair around his ears is really long for some reason. There are a few loose threads, and the tag is in an annoying spot. My husband says he likes it but I am greatly underwhelmed. If he didn't want to keep it, I would honestly return it, but it is sentimental, so I guess I can't now. It's a cute concept, but far too much money for what you get.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Paul Dennen,06/15/2021,I am glad that I purchased a clone of my Kenzie. She is a service dog who I am losing to cancer. This will be with me always. I think it was worth the money spent. Delivery time is long and I refuse to pay extra for a shorter time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Aidan B,06/14/2021,"We recently lost our little button quail, Tatertot. Because we hatched him, I wanted to get something in his memory. I heard about Cuddle Clones through an ad and after seeing the reviews, I was happy to see they did pieces for all kinds of animals. The airbrushing matches his feather patterns almost perfectly, and his little feet are the best. Thank you to the artists and team members of this service!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AMY STACK,06/14/2021,"I feel that this company does not live up to its' reputation, with all the other clones pictured on this site. My cat's markings weren't matched up as well as it could be. Dean had a black stripe down his back and black through his tail, and black on every foot, and yet the clone was a solid gray throughout. The face didn't have his likeness either. I'm sorry, but I didn't think it was worth the money I spent on it. I was disappointed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Truman’s Human,06/13/2021,"I appreciate the quality and customer service, therefore 3 stars. But I will be selling or donating my custom cuddle clone. It does not really look like my dog. I’m pretty disappointed, but I know you’re reading this thinking it’s a white fluffy dog. I get it but the head shape and eyes and top of nose and white eyelashes are important… it’s a cute white dog. It’s just not Truman I really provided very good photos. Oh well. I knew the risk I was taking after reading the reviews. Some are great and some not so good. Again, super happy with the quality and customer service is A+++… good luck on yours. There’s many really happy people, I’m just meh.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Alison Fox,06/12/2021,"My husband bought my Cuddle Clone Plush of my Best Friend/Furbaby, Hercules! It is absolutely amazing and looks so much like him. When my Hercules plush arrived I was so excited and was so excited when I unboxed it. All I could say was WOW!!! It is also very good sized, larger than I expected so I was really happy with it. The picture was taken with the plush in my desk chair to give a good perspective of size. Yes, there are a few details missing but that is my fault because you need to make sure you get every angle of your pet and makes sure to photograph in very good light. Hercules is a shy guy and is not a fan of having his picture taken (it took 1 week to get every angle). I do love Cuddle Clones, I have the Plush, the Statue, the Pet Art Blanket, two of the large Coffee Mugs, and the Face Masks. Thank you Cuddle Clones, I know I'll be purchasing more items!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Caitlyn Delorme,06/12/2021,I was a little worried when I had to send him back but he has come home and he looks perfect I'm so happy. After Losing my baby in 2018 its been tough i have had him since i was 11 and he is my everything R.I.P Surviver My sweet puppy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cat N,06/11/2021," Just wanted you all to know that my sister LOVED her “Louie” the Pekinese Cuddle Clone. You all captured him perfectly. Even her cat Harriet (depicted) responded. Louie later in life became blind, and Harriet lovingly helped guide him around the house and was his little protector. It was very sweet and moving to see Harriet interacting with the Cuddle Clone of her best friend, and clearly, not only humans are comforted by your creations. You all even got his endearing tongue, a special quirk that made Louie, *Louie*. Excellent job once again, Cuddle Clones- you really brightened my sister’s (and Harriet’s) day.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Judy Vegter,06/10/2021," When I received the likeness of my Sassy I was overwhelmed by how much she resembled my precious fur baby. Your attention to detail is fabulous and I will be able to enjoy this perfect likeness of my beloved baby girl from now on. Thank you so much for giving me something to help remember her by. She was one in a million and I can now have her likeness as she was, a sweet loving little girl. Sincerely, Ron and Judy Squires",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Samantha Cashmore,06/09/2021,"I honestly don't really know what to say. My mum and I bought this cuddle clone as a gift for my sister, whose dog had just passed. He was her dog, but he truly was a staple in our family and it was a devastating loss. I swear we probably read ALL of the reviews before purchasing, and after seeing how amazing they all were we decided to take the leap and purchase one. I am not going to lie, I was still a little anxious to see how it would work out, as he meant so much to my sister and I just wanted him to be perfect. Today, we finally got to see! As soon as the box was open, there were tears, and I don't think they've stopped. He is PERFECT. And I mean, PERFECT. That's really all I can say. Teddy was such a character, and had little quirks, like a tilted head when you spoke to him, and when he sat he had his little back leg out to the side that made you giggle every time you looked at him. They captured it all. Even his pup \brother\"" was confused when he saw him and immediately started pawing at him to play. If you are on the fence",I honestly wouldn't hesitate. I was worried I hadn't truly explained his quirks when I ordered and wrote to the team to chat with someone and she was WONDERFUL. Stellar product,and amazing customer service. Sure he was a little pricey,but there is nothing more priceless than the response to seeing him emulated in a stuffed animal. I will be ordering again in the future. Thank you,from the bottom of my heart. (We put his own bowtie on him in the photos,"it did not come with the pet)""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Elena Price,06/08/2021,"I did some digging online and found a few reviews that said the plush clone didn't turn out well, but for the most part all of the reviews were positive. So, I was a little worried, but I decided to go for it anyway and figured I could just get a refund if it didn't turn out right. Not only did it come much earlier than expected, but it also turned out beautifully. I was worried that her fur color wouldn't be the same, because it can be hard to see in pictures, but it was perfect (so perfect it was almost scary) I didn't expect to get as emotional as I did, and I am so happy with it. So if you're having doubts about this, I think you should definitely just go for it, it's so worth it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hannah Merchant,06/08/2021,AMAZING!! I was honestly a little worried it would come out looking cheap or not exactly like him but i’m so impressed. when I showed the clone to my family they immediately had mistaken it for my actual guinea pig. I can’t say enough about how identical they are. every little detail from size and proportions to the hairs that differ in color are perfect . definitely worth the money if not more.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Kristen Hemmis,06/08/2021,After my beloved lionhead bunny suddenly crossed the rainbow bridge I was devastated. He was the fur love of my life. His absence was too much to bare. My husband ordered me a cuddle clone. It helps fill that empty spot a bit. I can look at him and be reminded that he's still in my heart. It's hard to explain it. It helps me with the grief. The company is great. They communicated with me the whole time. I paid to have it made in a month and I received it exactly in a month.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rachel,06/07/2021,"I should have taken a 'before' picture, but Benelli's mustache just wasn't wide enough and her eyebrow was almost three times the size it should have been. I very carefully trimmed the eyebrow to the correct size and darkened/widened her mustache and now I consider it perfect. I tend to be on the picky side so I can't take stars off for those things, especially because I had no problem fixing them. I love this CuddleClone so much. I am so lucky every day I still have my girl and I know this will bring comfort when she's gone. Thank you!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Alana Foskey-Martin,06/06/2021,"This is the second cuddle clone we have purchased. Both of them were for furbabies that have passed away. Both of them were also perfect. (On our second clone, they paid great detail to the specifics I mentioned, right down to his pink nose that was outlined black) They have both brought a smile back to our faces and have helped ease the pain. Very much worth the money spent and the time it takes to be made.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Emi Jones,06/05/2021,Just perfect! We lost our little dog and wanted a reminder of how much joy he brought to us. His birthday was coming up and we wanted to have the Cuddle Clone to help us through our first year without him. They were so easy to work with and the customer service was excellent .He ended up on our doorstep the day before his birthday. We opened it on the big day and were amazed at how much he looks like Pickle. We could not be happier!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Linda Bates,06/03/2021," Erin C.’s Reviews 5.0 star rating My boy, my baby boy blue Frenchie, \Rump\"" passed away April 29th suddenly & unexpectedly. It was devastating. I am grieving still. However",I came across this site for Cuddle Clones where you can order a replica of your pet. I wasn't so sure but found information and ordering so easy. The way they asked for specific views in photos,specific details about Rump and their customer service in follow up communications really put me at ease. But I had no idea what I was about to receive. Today,only a handful of weeks later,I got the most beautiful gift. He is so perfect I don't even want to call him a stuffed animal because he is so much more than that! Their artists really caught Rump's essence and I cannot express in mere words the great comfort this has given me. I ordered the zipper belly and have already put some special momentos inside. My cat is a li'l freaked out because the resemblance is so uncanny. The quality is off-the-charts and I just couldn't be happier. That's 5 stars! I'm so happy. Cuddle Clones,you've truly brought joy to this broken heart. And I wanna' tell anyone that is looking for a gift for someone struggling with deep grief over the loss of a beloved pet to consider doing this. Check it out my picture of my boy and his Cuddle Clone! Thank you from the bottom of my heart,"Linda Bates""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jennifer Hensley,06/02/2021," I just wanted to take a moment and tell you how extremely pleased I am with the cuddle clone of my Niko. When I first saw the package there was a mixture of excitement and trepidation. I was partly afraid it wouldn't look like him and I would be disappointed and I was partly afraid it would look like him and I'd start bawling my eyes out. It's been almost a year since I lost him to CHF and I wasn't sure if I were ready to see a clone of him yet. It took me eight days to feel ready to even open the box. I finally opened the box right before Mother's day and, omg, when I first saw his back, I was very pleasantly surprised. Then, when I picked him up, I immediately had tears in my eyes, happy tears, because it looked sooo much like my Niko. You guys nailed his kinky ears and longer tail, and also his many spots on his back and chest. It felt good to HUG him again. I'm also glad I got the pouch as I put some of his hair clippings and ashes inside so I feel like I'm really hugging him again. On Mother's Day I brought Niko with me to my mom's house and, at first sight, my mom actually thought it was Niko, then she thought I had gotten another Cavalier puppy. She could not believe how much he looked like Niko. She, too, immediately started crying. I just wanted to thank you and let you know what a wonderful job you did in recreating my precious furbaby. It's nice to have him sitting on his favorite quilt in the livingroom and not have to look at an empty quilt. It gives me comfort to see Niko's clone sitting there. It's also nice to be able to pick him up and bring him to bed with me at night. So I just wanted to say thank you for making a difficult time a little bit easier.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Robert Blaker,06/02/2021,We received our plush clone of Bentley today. I must say we are rather pleased with the turnout. The plush clone looks almost identical. Good enough for us. Now we have our Bentley back ! ! We are happy with our purchase.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Kayla Cook,06/01/2021,I know its not 100% perfect but as soon as i opened the box i was crying because it was very close enough to my cat who passed away in April. He looks very adorable and im so glad i found this company!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hope Casaul,05/29/2021,I honestly have a loss for words. The detail is unreal. The first order I got it looked nothing like my Mr. Bun Buns. I decided to give cuddle clones a second chance and they did not disappoint. Mr. Bun Buns passed March 1st at only 6 years of life from GI stasis. When I got the the 2nd order in the mail I couldn't believe it. I put it in the pen with Bun (Mr. Bun Buns best friend) and he put his head under it because he thought it would lick him just like Mr. Bun Buns did when he was alive. It's still so sad. But I am happy to say cuddle clones really did it and I thank them with all my heart. I attached a collage of the real Mr.Bun Buns and the replica.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Keri Daley,05/29/2021,He’s perfect.. I had to put down my dog last October who was 15 years old.. I had him my entire childhood.. he was my everything and I’ve been having such a hard time with his death.. I finally had enough money to be able to get a cuddle clone and it came out better then I could have imagined.. they made him just like I asked him .. I wanted it to look like I never lost him even if he was an old man.. they gave him his skin patches and his scars.. his eyes are alittle creepy but everything else down to the curved tail is amazing and it couldn’t have been any better..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Keith Evanouskas,05/23/2021," After 17 years I lost my best friend. Nothing in the world could ever replace her, I saw an ad for this site and I knew that this was the perfect way to pay her tribute. To me she was in a league of her own, and the likeness of her cuddle clone is just uncanny. Thank you for helping me to keep her close in a way I could of never imagined. The only thing I was disappointed with was how it was shipped - she came in a flimsy extremely dented brown cardboard box with only 2 pieces of tissue paper on top to protect. It did not seem to have the care of packaging as it did the care of creation. Special thank you to the artist, I wish I knew your name, who crafted this wonderful urn for my forever best friend, Josie. ❤️",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Jen Randall,05/22/2021,My husband and I lost our cat Checkers suddenly in March and decided to order a cuddle clone because it was really hard on us.

Ashley Gomez,05/21/2021,"Considering the high cost, it’s quite disappointing in what we got versus what I ordered for my mother. Our girl passed away in March. I grew up with her and she was very attached to me as well. Wanted to do something special for my mother so I ordered her a cuddleclone and a figurine. I put notes in there that I wanted the figurines head to be down on her stuffed elephant (which I seen them do toys in the figurines before so I knew it was possible) and then her cuddleclone was to be down like the normal down positions. But they got it mixed up and they had her cuddleclones head down instead. Just looks really off, it kind of looks like her but she just looks really sad and not the way I wanted the clone to come out like. The figurine didn’t include the elephant at all and one of the letters on her name came chipped. They said I can send it back and they can remake it but it’s a hassle to ship stuff out when I’m working throughout the week. The biggest problem with their ordering system is that it’s hard to be in complete detail with word limit caps. But I did specify that I only wanted that with the head down with the figurine only. Also don’t know why they had her legs crossed, so I tried to fix it but it naturally corrects itself when moved.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sue Stewart,05/20/2021,"We lost our cat, Quibbles, at only 9 years old in April, and were devastated. Nothing will ever be exact to him but they did such a great job at his likeness and capturing all the special things that made him unique. His favorite laying position with on leg stretches out, multi-colored toebeans, light bulb tail, and even his heart shaped spot. We opened it and I cried. We put his collar on the clone so it’s like he’s here with us even though he’s not anymore.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I definitely recommend getting yourself a stuffy made of your beloved pet they did phenomenal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rowena Alcala,05/17/2021,I ordered a replica of my daughter's deceased dog. She had the dog from the time she was 13 till adulthood. The dog passed away three years ago.

Kate Williams,05/16/2021,"My pup recently passed and I was hoping to be able to look at my Cuddle Clone and be reminded of him... but this isn't my dog. I'm disappointed because the other pictures of their work look great! Not sure why mine wasn't given the same attention to detail. It was really difficult emotionally to box it up and send it back. I chose to return the product instead of asking for updates - it was just too far away from the photos provided. I wish they allowed updates and a guarantee if those updates still aren’t satisfactory, a refund would be given after a final return. 3 stars for the good customer service and easy return process. I hope your experience is better!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jordan Owens-Hall,05/15/2021," I ordered a Cuddle Clone as a surprise for my mom, and I could hardly stand the wait until she could finally open the package. We laughed, we cried, and we missed our goodest boy who left far too soon. They got Theodore down 100%: His color is spot on, the way his white marks are, that sweet face and luscious tail. As my mom said: \I'm just looking at him","expecting him to talk to me.\"" Thank you to all the talented people who put so much effort into making this gift super special.

They really were able to catch his likeness. When I come home it still kind of makes me feel like my fur baby is still with me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Vincent’,05/13/2021,"Our dear dog Popis passed away, and of course we were devastated. A while later I was looking for an anniversary gift for her, and a radio personality I follow mentioned that he had one made for his dog and how well made it was. So I placed an order, and I was BLOWN AWAY with the results. My wife cried tears of joy for almost an hour when she got it. I knew that they would do a good job but, the result was even better than I imagined.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Aaliyah Olivarez,05/13/2021,Absolutely love it! Perfection. The team got every detail right about him. My aunt lost her best friend Jack a few years ago and is still coping. When she saw the amazing product that cuddle clones created she instantly knew it was Jack. It brought her to tears (happy tears) and she felt like a piece of her was back. Thank you guys soo much it was such a masterpiece.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dana Tallman,05/12/2021,I just got the headcover and I'm blown away at how great the headcover is. It is almost so nice that I'm not sure I want to subject it to the rigors of a round of golf. I wasn't sure how this would turn out. Keyno has an aversion to being photographed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Richard BERGESON,05/10/2021,Lee was very helpful and understanding of my loss. The clone I received looks so much like him I have to look twice. It sits overlooking my deck where Romeo would watch the squirrels. I think about him everything I look at it. It's help me greatly in my loss of my buddy 🥰,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy Devine,05/10/2021,"First off, thank you all so much for the work you all do to help people like me with the grief process. It’s been 3 years since Kimber passed away and I’m just now getting to do this. Missing her so much and having my stuffed Kimber to hug and hold makes it so much easier. I simply love my Kimber that you all made for me.. There are just not enough words to express how happy and satisfied I am with my Kimber. The only thing I can do, is to continue to tell people about all of you and what you all can do. Again, thank you from the bottom of my heart..",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Belle McAleer,05/10/2021," I have been waiting in anticipation for the arrival of my Finian who was put to rest just four weeks ago. I opted to pay extra so that he was shipped within four weeks rather than the standard eight and he arrived within that time frame. Opening the box I was taken back for a moment, I could just see his back and I swear it was Finian himself. He is a perfect clone. The colour and coat pattern is so mirrored I can't believe it. You have done such amazing work. I want you to make sure that you give the actual person who cloned Finian a huge hug for me. They are so talented, I couldn't be happier. The photo's I have uploaded doesn't do it justice, it honestly is so perfect in real life. I have been startled three times already where I walk into the room and see him and forget and freak out cause at that second I think its Finian. Thank you Cuddle Clones so much, you have made a piece of my heart whole again. Five STARS for Finian.....BUT I got the pajama bottoms as well and the material is terrible. The print and concept is cute but there's no way I could wear them. I can only describe the material as being like lycra. You would sweat like crazy in them, they are unbreathable, really cheap polyester and disappointing. So with that, I am taking off one STAR.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Natalie Zrinsky,05/09/2021,"Tragically we lost our little Sid in January of this year. It left all of us with a hole in our hearts. After hearing about cuddle clones I had to check it out for myself. I put together the order of Sid and waited. I was so nervous that what I got in the mail would look like a gremlin rather than my baby boy, but I was in tears when my package finally arrived! It looks so much like Sid it scares me sometimes. We have him sitting in his favorite chair in my living room and every time we pass by we swear he’s sitting there. Cuddle clones did a fantastic job!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Alyx Aguilar,05/09/2021,Words cannot express how much I adore my clone. It looks exactly how I thought it would. Obviously its not exact but im so in love. Even came a few weeks earlier than expected. I want to thank everyone involved. Customer service was awesome. Also i just cant get enough of the way it sits just like my baby! I love it! Thank you!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Kim Leinaar,05/08/2021,My Pile and Bandit are together again. Losing both within a month of each other was very difficult.

Junko Wada,05/07/2021,"First of all, thank you so much for great customer support, Dylan! I had to make some changes after placing the order and the response was super quick and was very very helpful. I received cuddle clones soon after the shopping notification and the whole process was so smooth and fast! We had lost our beloved cat Debbie 2 months ago but having the cuddle clone is giving us some comfort and our other cat is also loving to have her old friend back:) Thank you so much!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nicole Watson,05/06/2021,It feels like we have her back again. The grief has been so unbearable and this cuddle clone came back looking SO much like our Mars. No regrets. Thankyou cuddle clones for capturing her essence.Ofcourse nothing will ever ever replace her but it helps ❤️,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Racheal Marie Mclain,05/04/2021,"My cuddle clone is absolutely beautiful and the quality is amazing. However, his fur is at least 4 shades darker than Harley was. The cuddle clone fur is dark brown, and Harley had reddish brown fur. It's a beautiful memorial for him, the markings are EXACTLY like his were but the wrong fur color makes it look like any other dog to me. That just makes me sad because I got the cuddle clone to ease the pain but it doesn't look like him.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Melinda Garcia,05/04/2021,"Words can’t express how I feel. Charlie wasn’t just our pet he was our baby. Our first born. We had Charlie for 13 years and when he passed I knew I had to order a cuddle clone to keep his memory alive. Not only did you capture his image you captured his spirit. I can see his little smirk on his face, his color matches perfectly, the length of his hair is just right. I can’t thank you enough for taking the time to match our images perfectly into a plush. We will cherish our cuddle clone for ever!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Niccole Garner,05/01/2021,"Three years ago I had to make the tough decision to put down my feline companion. She was just barely a year old and I had only had her for half that time however she fell ill and after numerous tests and visits there was just nothing that could be done. I had to let her go. It never gets easier, pictures would make me emotional and every once in a while, I’d find myself coming here and considering ordering a clone but something felt “too soon” for me. This year, my husband told me I should order it. His support meant the world because it gave me the nudge to actually put the order in this time and I am so glad I did. I received it today, and the plush is amazing to me. It looks like my Autumn girl and it brought back so many sudden memories. I have some generic calico plushes but they didn’t feel “right” and here, you guys work to make pets look like their photos and now I have a plush that is one of a kind. She is my Autumn. Thank you to the cuddle clones team who provides and dedicates their time to making these plushes. Despite being emotional seeing my girl after three years, I am so happy to have something that looks like her that I can hug and cuddle up with on the more difficult days. I am absolutely pleased with my purchase and would consider ordering again in the future and recommending to anyone who was looking for such a personalized plush.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Anonymous,04/29/2021,"After our beloved Melody passed away a few months ago, managing our grief was very difficult. With the Cuddle Clone it almost feels like Melody is back and we are so happy.

Mandee Hernandez,04/29/2021," Our Cuddle Clone is the perfect memorial for our beloved dog, Seamus. While not 100% perfect recreation, it was well worth the time and price for our family. Backstory: Seamus was our first dog. He made us a family. For 9 years he was our world. We were devastated when he was diagnosed with Lymphoma and through Chemo we had a wonderful additional year with him. We were heartbroken when his time finally came and he lost his battle in early 2021. Our family had a big void immediately without him. A few weeks after he passed we learned about Cuddle Clones. We knew right away this would be something we wanted to have. While the clone doesn't look like him 100%, he is a perfect memorial to our special boy. It captures his essence and key physical features that we know it's him as soon as we see him. I cried when I opened the box and saw my boy again. Our other dog, Seamus's sister, really looked and smelled him and even greeted him like a real dog. We catch her looking at him from time to time and know she's thinking of her brother. Of course a stuffed animal doesn't replace our boy, but our Cuddle Clone has been an incredible healing tool through our grief. I would highly recommend this for anyone, like us, who loved their pet as family. And would love something to see, feel, hug, and love forever in their honor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Holly,04/28/2021,After my dog died my young daughter had a hard time coping with the lose. I found cuddleclones and ordered one. It made a world of a difference. I can’t believe how well they do paying attention to the fine details. Absolutely recommend it!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Karen Izzi Gallagher,04/28/2021,"The real test of whether or not the Cuddle Clone resembled our beloved cat Hobbes was approval by our 2 year old granddaughter. If she recognized him, hugged him, called him by name, then it was a success. Sure enough, after unboxing Hobbes 2.0, she carefully checked him over then pointed at the floor for me to put him down. She slowly walked around him, got down on the floor, grabbed him, gave him the biggest bear hug and kissed him non-stop. Then she ran off into another room with him to have a private conversation. So does he look exactly like our Hobbes? Not exactly, but pretty darn close. Close enough for our granddaughter to dance and play with her best buddy again. And for us to think, at a glance or from a distance, that our best boy is sitting by the fireplace waiting for a little hug. Thank you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Matthew Vecera,04/27/2021,After my Patchies passed away las month I finally got my cuddle clone of her and let me just say how happy and grateful I am of this company.

Yanxia Zhang,04/27/2021," The size is good, matching almost the real size. Eyes are also great and shining! But there are several issues: 1. The proportion is really bad. 2. It doesn't stay even both front size and back side, there are almost 2 fingers height difference horizontally. 3. One of the back leg is in a very weird position that it is built out from the other back leg. 4. Overall it doesn't capture the essentials of pictures we sent. It doesn't look alike our dog. We did 3 different figurines after our beloved dog passed away. Two are from cuddleclones, one sculpture from the other service. The other cuddleeclone one is a 3D print which is great except too small. We wish the plush cuddle clone could be like the 3D print one with bigger size, unfortunately it doesn't.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chloe Forsythe,04/26/2021,"I was really unsure about getting a cuddle clone of my beloved friend, Baby, as there weren't that many cat examples that I thought looked right. I was shocked with the quality of the plush I received. The eyes and face look just like my cat's! However, the fur color was all wrong. A very kind associate, Dylan, relayed all my requests to the artists during the remake process. They also listened to all my concerns and really let me rest assured that the Cuddle Clone team would do a better job this time. Happy to say that the new plush I received looks much closer to my boy. This will tide me over until I can hug him for real again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They are getting married next weekend and had plans to include him in the engagement and wedding celebrations, but cancer took him very quickly. My wife and I wanted to make sure he could still be a part of their special day, so we ordered and rushed a cuddle clone for them and he turned out fantastic. There were a lot of tears when I opened the package and saw him, and even more tears when we gifted him to his humans. This was such a fun way to honor Brody Bear, and the artists took such care in creating him.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Charissa Wright,04/20/2021," I was really excited ab getting this for my husband when our dane was diagnosed with osteosarcoma. Our family was really heartbroken. But when I saw the merle dane online I thought it will be perfect. Our dane had his ears but I thought it would be easy. I feel like I sent really good pics of him, his coat, his features, described him to the tee. For $212, I was so disappointed when I opened him. My husband cried at the gesture but we just don't love it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Matthew Vecera,04/19/2021,My mom and I lost our baby Precious last year and we received her cuddle clone today and it brought joy and tears to our eyes. The details is amazing and unbelievable.

Sarah Benson,04/19/2021,"I’ve spent some time now pondering how to write this review. So here it goes. Is it expensive? -Yes. Is it a waste of money? -No and here is why... I lost Bindi, my border collie on august 29th 2020 to old age(14). My other dog, Annie, who is a very nervous sheltie, spent her whole life following Bindi and happily being her sidekick. When we lost Bindi, It completely shattered her world. A few months later I lost my dad and that made her life even more miserable. We put her on puppy Prozac to help with the anxiety and depression. When i ordered this cuddle clone, I had every intention keeping in my room for myself. When “fake Bindi” arrived we put Bindi’s collar on the CC. Of course we showed Annie and that’s when everything changed. Immediately, she started wagging her tail and showed interest in something for the first time in months. No bag of treats or pieces of steak could get her attention like this CC did. This was something I never imaged would be helpful for her. Now when Annie gets really excited, she will walk up to “fake Bindi” sniffing her collar as if she’s trying to share the excitement with her. She will lay by fake Bindi whenever we are downstairs. She even sleeps by fake Bindi. It is very obvious that this has helped Annie find comfort and peace in her life without her best friend. So yes, this is an expensive purchase, it’s a big decision and one worth every penny. Helping Annie find a little joy again is priceless. Thank you wonderful artists and staff members that worked on my beautiful Bindi baby❤️ it is SO much more than a stuffed animal and Annie really taught me that. -Sarah and Annie",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Maryanne DeYoung,04/18/2021,"I was floored when I opened the box! It looks just like my baby!

Harper,04/11/2021,"Very cute plushie! I wanted a clone of my dog (to remember and love forever) and I'm glad I found (and purchased) a CuddleClone. The darker fur on the CuddleClone is because I used my dog's back fur as reference (the front half of my dog is a light tan/cream, the back is the darker brown). I would have liked to have a lighter head color, but the markings and fur length on the head are correct (it even has a little pink around the eyes, which I love). My main critique is that I wish my CuddleClone's mouth was wider (it's somewhat narrow) BUT they added the little tongue peeking out, which is adorable (it was also in the reference pictures)! In general, its not -exactly- like my dog, but going off of pictures, it's really nice. The one thing the pictures can't show, is that (in person) my CuddleClone *feels* like my dog. The CuddleClone captured the \essence\"" of my dog and that's what I see when I'm with him. Again","that's something no picture can describe. I highly recommend buying one of you own CuddleClones!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Breanne Iffert,04/10/2021,"My sweet girls Lucy (chow/shepherd mix) and Phoebe (german shepherd) passed away within a week of each other this last February, and my husband surprised me with my very own Cuddle Clones.

Thank you for this wonderful gift!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Debbie-Ann Trudeau,04/10/2021,"We just received our Sydney Clone. We are very happy with the results. We did not expect an exact copy of our baby and there are small differences (for example: size and shape of her head) but we are very impressed with the attention to detail of the artist. Her face, colouring, body and tail are incredibly good. Our baby has been gone for just over a month, but having our Sydney Clone helps with us with the grieving. We sometimes do a double take when we see her and for a moment she is our Sydney and not Sydney Clone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Margaret Remy,04/05/2021,"When I had to have my 16-year-old cat, Smokey, euthanized, I really wanted a cuddleclone. At age 82, it was an expense I couldn't justify; and my children wouldn't have an appreciation for the cuddleclone. The mask is a very practical way to memorialize Smokey. People see the paw prints first and then find the photo, so I would have loved a larger image; but I am very pleased with the mask.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Megan Stock,04/03/2021,"I lost my beloved fur baby Brody in February & I was so severely depressed and dealing with so much grief. I had heard about these stuffed animal clones of your pets before and I had known all along I wanted one when my dog passed, so when he finally did, I did the research and found Cuddle Clones. Their clones look incredible, the reviews were amazing and I love that they give back with their proceeds. the process of customization was a little tedious, of picking out multiple pictures of Brody in lots of different angles, but it was important to getting all the details right when you want your clone to look as identical as possible. The wait for receiving him was a little hard, considering I was grieving and very sad, but let me tell you, when the box arrived, and I took ”Brody” out, I smiled again. For the first time since he passed. I couldn’t believe how my sadness turned to happy tears. I felt like he was back home. all I had was his ashes and pictures before & now I felt like I had something to physically touch and look at. For the first time since losing him I really felt a sense of calm, relief and it made me happy. It will never get easier to grieve for Brody. He was my best friend, my fur baby, my soul mate, the light of my life. But somehow, in someway, Cuddle Clones gave me the best healing “tool” I ever thought possible. All of Brody’s adorable features, especially his face, that made missing him so hard, that I felt like I didn’t physically have around anymore, I feel like I’ve somehow got that back in a sense. Thank you Cuddle Clones for giving me a reason to smile again and bringing Brody home to me. you have no idea how much it means to me. I feel like you returned a piece of my heart to me. And I love you guys so much for it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Brittany Stallard,04/02/2021,"You know, i understand that these are expensive, but they truly are worth it! I'm going to be honest, i was a little disappointed in the ears and the nose. I felt the nose could've have been more flat and the ears were a little off. However i also know that they go solely off of the pictures provided and with that being said, i really can't complain. Just give them everything you think they need to know. I think what this company does is absolutely amazing. I'm completely satisfied with the entire process. Once you place your order, you get an email informing you on what to expect, and they email you throughout the process keeping you informed. Even with the little disappointments i have, i still praise this company and tell everybody about them! I take the blame for whatever i was disappointed in because like i said, they can only go off of what is given to them. And with that being said, they did a great job!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
May,03/29/2021, We bought our cuddle clone for my great aunt who has been in hospice during covid. She hasn’t been able to see her dog or her family except though a glass window for over a year. I don’t think it could have been more perfect or made her happier.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Monica Brennan,03/28/2021,"I lost my dog in January and found out about this site. I was so excited to recreate my dog in a stuffed animal just to be able to have solid memories of him. Paid the extra money to get it done quicker. When it finally came in and I opened the box the first thing I saw was the tail and his back. It’s was so much like his that I broke down and cried. When I finally had enough courage to pull him out of the box to fully look at it, it wasn’t his face. I was disappointed to say the least. I couldn’t figure out what exactly was off but then realized it’s his nose. With that though I would probably still buy another. Just need to make sure to capture all angles of the face",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Annie Richard,03/28/2021,Thank you so much for your great work! I am very happy with the result of the cuddle clone of my 12 years old dog Flora. They look so much alike.

Priscilla Alaniz,03/21/2021,"When I saw that my cuddle clone had been delivered today while I was at work I was both scared and nervous. Since I lost my boy at the end of January I just wanted to have something to cherish forever, other than a photograph. Boy, was I not only happy and grateful with this cuddle clone, but very impressed. They got all of his markings down correctly, even down to the slightest browning of his hair on his hind legs. They did such a good job that my poor girls actually thought it was him. They started licking his mouth and giving him kisses like they would when they wanted him to play with them. I am forever grateful, and will be purchasing more cuddle clones of all my other pups. Thank you so much! You have another very satisfied customer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have one cat that will sleep with him, its just like old times. He will be going on a road trip soon to meet my daughters cuddle clone dog. They were very close. Thank you again for doing such a great job.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Amy H,03/19/2021,"The Cuddle Clone of our dog Bayla was amazing and so realistic. Our sweet girl passed away in January at the age of 15. When we opened the package today, it felt like we were hugging her again. Thank you so much for the time, effort, and care your company put in creating such an awesome gift.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Customer,03/18/2021,"This cuddle clone is nice but I for one wouldn’t go overboard about it. Where’s the w@w factor. My partner had it made for me without a pocket, his mistake I know so I can’t even put her ashes in it & if I’m tbh, it’s overly priced for wot it is, there’s no intricate detail to the feet & if this company was all that there would be a no quibble money back guarantee. I’m sorry but I’m not going to say oh my god it’s brilliant if I don’t think it is. Prove me wrong, otherwise I’ll give a. 7/10 & I’m sorry but that’s at a push, I’d say more a 6, fact & no bendy wires & bits like I’ve heard others have. Cavaliers have bushy tails, can’t you put something in it to give it some hold here & there? I’ve put a pic up of my Rio.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Shirley Hollis,03/17/2021,I just received my Cuddle Clone and I’m so pleased not only with the resemblance but with the workmanship. Thank you so much for bringing a precious memory back to me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Evangelina Rangel,03/17/2021,"Finally, my Layla is back home with me. I must say I am so very happy with the finished product. The zipper pouch was probably the best investment that I included because I was able to fit mostly all her pics, a small urn and clothing of hers. I love all of her. The customer service was excellent and Charlotte was one of the representatives that helped me out alot through the process. Thanks again Charlotte! 😊 Anyway, I filled with so much bliss because now Layla will always be by my side. Thank you cuddle clones for returning my Layla back home with me😊. You guys did a pawsome job!🐾❤",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lisa Dixon,03/15/2021,My little Chloee clone came on Saturday. I was nervous opening the box and prayed it would look like her. She is a little bigger then Chloee was but looks so much like her that when I walk into the room it takes me a second to realize that it isn’t her. It is actually comforting when I see her and will also be the urn for her ashes. Thank you!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yumi HOHM,03/13/2021,"What can I say but Thank you, Thank you! My sister lost her precious dog Sammie and was in a world of pain. I knew a Cuddle Clone of Sammie would help heal her heart. We went to work gathering different angles of Sammie and wrote special details about him. Needless to say, Cuddle Clones followed all our instructions to the tee! They went above and beyond. My sister is more than overjoyed!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Corrie Menard,03/12/2021,"When my son’s most beloved fur buddy passed away there was little we could do to comfort him. I had seen advertisements of cuddle clones and decided to invest in a cuddle clone. We were amazed with how fabulous his clone turned out. In every detail, they brought Mr. Bear back to life. Will definitely be recommending to all my fellow pet lovers. Thanks so much!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Michelle Glover,03/12/2021,Our hearts were broken when we lost Bear. I came across the sight and figured I’d give it a try. His replica is so incredibly life-like. The artists did such an amazing job that people have to look at the picture twice after being told it’s not a real dog!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Laura McHenry,03/11/2021,There are no words to describe how amazing these cuddle clones turned out. I lost both my boxers and they did an incredible job clonig my boxer babies and making them look so realistic. Thank you from the bottom of my heart....I am in love with my cuddle clones,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Lori Pompu,03/11/2021,My daughter got a cuddle clone a couple of years ago after her cat passed. She absolutely loved having a stuffed animal of her exact pet. Unfortunately a few months ago her puppy got a hold of it and destroyed it. I couldn’t afford to buy her another one but luckily the cuddle clone company sometimes runs contests to win a free pet. I entered one their free pet contests back in December and wouldn’t you know it....I won a free cuddle clone and was able to surprise my daughter with another cuddle clone of her cat. It was a wonderful gift to win and she loves her new Daisy cat. Thank you so much cuddle clones for the free pet. My girl is beyond thrilled to have her cuddle clone cat again. I recommend this company!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cody Childers,03/11/2021,I'm not going to lie I was nervous when I ordered but I got it in today and I was shocked! It really does look like him. Very satisfied. Only thing I could come up with that I felt would of blown me off my chair is it being more lifesize. But for detail and how he looked they did a exceptionally great job! Would recommend if you have lost a pet.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jodi Bjornson,03/09/2021,"We lost our beloved Tinker in January and ordered a Cuddle Clone the very next day. I cannot express how much we love our new Cuddle Clone. It looks so much like our dog, it’s almost eerie! We are going to keep her on our couch in her favorite spot. It looks like Tinker is back with us in our home. Thank you, Cuddle Clones!! We love her!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Alexis Vera,03/05/2021, It looks just like my girl! All my other pets are freaked out by how lifelike it is ♥️♥️♥️ I'm 100% recommending this to all my friends and family!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Robert Shafer,03/05/2021,It brought my wife to tears. Best gift ever. The process was easy and I am very happy with finished product. It came way quicker than expected.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
David Mizejewski,03/05/2021,I will keep this short and simple. The figure that Cuddle Clones made of my dearly departed cat Bug is nothing short of incredible in its detail and accuracy. It really is like a miniature version of him is with us again in life.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Heather Columbus,03/04/2021,When we received it we couldn't believe how well made it was.. my girls thought it was really him. As well as one of his fur brothers. Thanks again,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stephanie Wilton-Duncan,03/04/2021,Very happy with the process and product. We bought a clone for my husband’s mother who loves our dog and who has been isolated during Covid . The ordering was thorough but easy and the product arrived sooner than expected. We were happy with the replica which she recognized at once and she loves having a companion to hold for comfort.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Erik Ross,03/03/2021,"Our furbaby, Trinity, passed away suddenly just after Christmas and we took it very hard. I'll admit that this purchase was a \greif buy\""",but I don't regret it a bit. The artists that worked on creating this Cuddle Clone were amazing and the level of detail speaks for itself. We opted for the hidden pouch,"and we have a small container with a lock of her fur in it as a keepsake. I do recommend as a unique and tangible memorial to a lost pet.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nikki,02/24/2021,I ordered a Cuddle Clone of our beloved Suki for a Christmas gift to my fiance'. We had a few scares in regards to her health in the past 5 years and in November the vet recommended us medication for her health issue. It didn't look good and we were mentally preparing to say goodbye to her. The medication was like a miracle and we were so lucky to have her with us for a few more months before her health deteriorated so rapidly in January. We could see that she was in pain and suffering and we had to make the most painful decision to put her to sleep in the beginning of February. We miss her immensely and we are so thankful we have a Cuddle Clone of her. I have hugged it for comfort at night and in the daytime we place it on the cat tree for our other cat Mojo. Thank you so much for creating this beautiful keepsake for us.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Steve S,02/22/2021,"I lost my sweet little pug mix Lucy recently. She was the light of my life and her passing has devastated me beyond words. The likeness Cuddle Clones created of her puts a smile on my face and reminds me of the non-stop joy Lucy gave me for more than 15 years. Nothing can replace her, but the cute little Plush Clone has brought me some peace.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Lechner,02/22/2021,"I purchased a Cuddle Clone for my friend who's dog was tragically killed on Christmas Eve. Kay was more than just special. Kay had been my foster dog and my friend fell in love with her. I was so excited when she adopted Kay at 8 weeks old. I have fostered over 300 puppies and Momma dogs but I don't ever get to see them grow and thrive. I was lucky enough to watch Kay grow and thrive for 7 yrs. She brought so much joy to her family and she had tons of personality. Kay was tragically killed on Christmas Eve and her family and I have been devastated. All I wanted to do was give her back to them. She had so much more joy to bring. Since that wasn't possible I did the best I could and had a Cuddle Clone made of Kay. The process was easy enough that even I could do it and I am a computer idiot! Her family loves their Kay Clone. It's crazy.....Kay's collar and pajamas were a perfect fit! Nothing could ever replace Kay, but it was the best I could do in a horrible situation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Maddie,02/14/2021,I received my clone a few months ago and cried it reminded me so much of my yellow lab Ally that passed away a few years ago she was my best friend and it hurt to not have her anymore but with this it feels like she is still here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Taylor,02/13/2021,"Talented artists and quick! I ordered him the night my bubba died, added 2 week rush, and had him in hand 13 days later—impressive!! He’s quite handsome and a nice homage to my late baby. The cons are that his markings aren’t as dark as they were in real life—namely the stripes on his back and his beautiful floofy striped tail which was a bummer. Also he has feet but his leg is missing like where is it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Marilynn Mitchell,02/12/2021,"Received my third Cuddle Clone recently. I love them all - Rosie, Pixie, and Chiki.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Christa,02/11/2021,"I was nervous about this order. I'm hurting so much, missing my Max. I wasn't sure what to expect. I opened the box and cried and hugged him. He looks just like my boy, expression, color, size. I love the little tummy pouch I can put his ashes and tag in. This has truly been a comfort to me. Thank you for taking such care in his creation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ilana,02/11/2021,"I received my Cuddle Clone of my beloved Shetland Sheepdog Sammy, this past Monday, February 1, 2021. I opened the box and took him out and broke down in tears. I have my “Sammy” back. My Sammy is So Real that When I hug my CuddleClone it feels like my Sammy is back in my arms. I highly recommend “Adopting” one. My heart is broken, but my Cuddle Clone Sammy fills the hole up a little every day.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

K.W.,02/07/2021,"I love my dog (Bella) so much that my parents got me a cuddle clone for my birthday. I opened the box and it wasn't perfect, but it was really close and really cute! I showed my dog her \twin\""",thinking that she would be jealous because she doesn't like other dogs normally,but she was just very confused. To her,it probably just smelled like a stuffie,yet it looked like a dog,so it was very confusing for her. After a while,she began to think that it was a real dog,so she play-bowed to invite it to play. To make her happy,"I made it seem like the \""dog\"" had accepted her invitation. Then the stuffie and her wrestled",played,and chased each other. It was really cute watching her reaction because she had never play-wrestled with a dog before. Now,she thinks that the stuffie is her friend and she loves it. I even find her licking it's nose and nuzzling it. It is the most adorable thing ever! It was supposed to just make me feel happy to have a memory of my dog to last for a lifetime,"but it made my dog happy too to have a new \""playmate\"". I think that this stuffie was all worth the money.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Caitlin Murphy,02/05/2021,"I just wanted to take a moment to say thank-you for my perfect replica of Jack! I know Dalmatians have to be harder than most of the breeds you all re-create, so I am more than grateful for the additional detail that was put into him. I am a Registered Veterinary Nurse (RVN) stationed overseas due to my husband’s active duty orders, so I sadly was not provided the opportunity to say good-bye to my best friend before he passed on. But thanks to Cuddle Clones being so kind to ship his replica all the way to Japan, I can finally have Jack in my arms again. I truly cannot thank you all enough! Keep up the amazing work!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Allana M.,02/04/2021,"Dexter's Cuddle Clone is close, but not quite as close as I expected for what I paid. The pictures I submitted were very clear as were my instructions for his color and I don't think those were followed as closely as they should have been. I think if I play around with it a bit I can get it to be a little closer. It can wear Dexter's clothes, so that is pretty cool. It's a little smaller than him, but close enough for the clothes to fit. The main thing is the beard, Dexter has a little white goatee and I referenced that in my instructions, on the Cuddle Clone the white is much wider, so I will probably try to dye it to make it the right width. That is one of Dexter's signature features, so I definitely want that to be right on the Cuddle Clone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Vlad Amalia,02/03/2021,"This clone is my soul, my relief since I lost my PUFYȚA! My beautiful PUFYȚA is back to ME. She whas \My angel with tail and fur\""","my baby! Thank you so much! You are The Best!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Teddy Bear,02/02/2021,It looks exactly like our Teddy Bear! It came in only 3 weeks to come and cuddle clones emailed us updates through the process. It was a easy process of ordering it and the only thing I noticed different was his colour was a tad bit darker. I completely recommend getting this!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chuck R.,02/02/2021," My wife and I decided to order a \clone\"" of Chance","the dog our 5 year old grandson grew up with. Chance had cancer and had to be put to sleep a little over year ago. Our grandson has been missing Chance very much and we thought that having a \""clone\"" would make him feel better. After getting the OK from our son we placed the order. It arrived today and it is AMAZING! Except for the size being a little small compared to Chance's adult size it is truly a \""clone\"" of him",better than we ever expected. Kudos and extreem gratitude go out to everyone that was involved in recreating Chance for our grandson! The ordering process was a bit surprising because nowhere on the website did I find any information on what was needed when placing an order. Be prepared to upload a number of photos from various perspectives (i.e. front,back,face,left side,right side,"etc.) They also ask some questions and provide a place to add additional \""facts\"". Don't skimp on the photos (not all are required) because the more details you provide the more accurate your \""clone\"" will be. All in all we feel it was well worth the cost and are very glad we made the purchase.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Lisa,02/01/2021,"Our beloved Molly passed in July. It has been a tremendous loss especially for my husband. I thought by getting a stuffed animal of her it would give us some peace.

Theresa,01/31/2021,We got Fifi in June of 2006.She filled our lives with such happiness and love. Fifi lost her hearing in 2010 at only 4 years old. Even though she couldn't hear you would never know that. She was Star's little sister but she was the tough one always looking out for the family. Sadly after 14 wonderful years we lost Fifi in August of 2020 after being diagnosed with heart failure it was devastating. Just like with Star we purchased a Cuddle Clone of Fifi. They both arrived at the same time. She also was perfect. She had a little tan on her ears and we asked if they could do that on her clone. They did just the right way not to dark.Now she is sitting in her bed where she loved to be next to Star's bed. We keep expecting them to jump out of their beds. That is how much like them they look. Thank you so much for everything you do!!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Theresa,01/31/2021,We got Star in June of 2006.She filled our lives with such happiness and love. Sadly Star was diagnosed with heart failure in July of 2019.She passed away in January of 2020at 13. We have been devastated since. Someone told us about Cuddle Clones so we finally tried it. We were nervous at first thinking how can they get it to look just like her. A year after Star passed January 19 2021 we got the email saying the Cuddle Clone was shipped. It must have been Star's way of saying she is coming home. When we opened the box we could not believe it.It is perfect it looks just like her. Now she is sitting in her bed where she loved to be. Feels good to not see an empty bed. Thank you so much for everything you do!!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gina Fernandez,01/31/2021,"My coworkers got a cuddle clone for me because we lost our dog od 14yrs on Christmas eve.

Migail Mack,01/30/2021,Thank you soooo much. You guys did a awesome job. And actually got my cuddle clone very fast. It's the best gift I have ever gotten. A way to remember my precious girl Mocha 2006-2020. 💞😊,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Karen,01/29/2021,It is a perfect replica of my beloved Bella. I love it and just having it helps with the pain of losing her on Christmas Eve. I have her watching over the bedroom on the top of my dresser where I will see her no matter where I'm at in the bedroom.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Alex Y,01/28/2021,"Our girl passed away last September. She was my big baby. When I opened the box and took my clone out, I could not help but cry. Cuddle Clones did an awesome job on my girl “Tasha”. You captured all of her special features, from her white eyebrows to the little white fur at the tip of her tail. The service was great. I ordered my clone on January 16th and I received it January 28th. 5 star rating *****",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Isabel Hughes,01/28/2021,I was so pleased with how this came out. I took it out of the box backwards and immediately started crying because of how real it looks. My Oreo died last month and this is so comforting. Will absolutely recommend Cuddle Clones to others. This is absolutely worth the price. Also came faster than expected — about 4 weeks versus the estimated 8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Christina,01/28/2021,After seeing some of the other photos I was so excited for a cuddle clone but it came out horribly. It doesn’t look like my Maddy at all. I have two other dogs and I’m very glad I decided to just start with one. Won’t be ordering any more!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Whitney M,01/27/2021,"My puppy I've had since I was in middle school recently passed away. I moved into my first apartment with her and took her everywhere with me. Couldn't stand the empty couch. I was so happy to see that they got my Jules just right, fur pattern was perfect and so were the ears. It was a lot bigger than I expected which was great, it wasn't far from her actual size just a little smaller. It looks like she's still sitting there. 10/10 recommend just make sure you send good photos!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

john kelly,01/25/2021," Our wonderful family member, Payton Kelly, is now 12 years old and going through a rough time fighting prostate cancer. As a surprise, I ordered a cuddle clone built off of pictures of him when he was a little puppy for my wife so she will always have a little bit of him with her. When I received it, I couldn't believe how good of a job they did. It looks just uncannily like him when he was a like 8-10weeks old. It even somehow captures his sweet personality, his essence. He has some subtle features I had to try to describe to our Cuddle Clones artist as they didn't show up that strong in the pictures, such as he has this caramel cream fur weaved through his back and on his ears. They nailed it, his wavy white / caramel cream fur on the clone is just like our Payton's. They even managed to capture the funny way he sits, we call it \side sitting.\"" When my wife had gone to bed I left him out on the couch where he likes to lay","and where I knew she would see him. In the morning I hear her walk down stairs and exclaim \""Oh my god!\"" She hugged him for the longest time and cried. Now he is everywhere she goes",sitting guard by her PC while she works,and cuddling with her while we watch TV (sure to be careful not to make real Payton jealous :)). It was just so well done,"and something we will cherish the rest of our lives as a heartwarming keepsake of our beloved Pooch. Thank you so much to the whole Cuddle Clones team!!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
LF,01/21/2021,"I knew once I heard about Cuddle Clones that we'd probably get one made in honor of our dear Lily. We knew it would be a momento for whenever she passed and unfortunately that time came at the end of 2020. It was a tough few weeks when she first left and I ordered her cuddle clone while pouring through 14 years of photos. Slowly our tears and grief turned into loving and happy memories of her better days. That is when we received our amazingly realistic little pint sized Lily! It was amazing how well done her body and markings were portrayed. Her fur on the chest and legs and tail could have been real! I tricked family members with some Facebook pics of the clone and they had to do double and triple takes to realize I was not posting old photos of her. My daughter immediately asked to let her \sit on her bed\"" for storytime","something we only ever did ONCE in her last few nights and it left a lasting impression. It's a joy to have her presence in our house again. Thank you so much to the staff and designers that took the time to make our Lily come to life.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DW,01/16/2021,"My heart lurched as I opened the box and pulled out the perfect replication of my dear Pekingnese, Brody. The colors of his fur are perfect and beautiful and it feels so realistic. The face is fantastic with expressive brown eyes and the nose even looks a little wet. I’m very glad that I chose to get the larger size. I think you can get them made to a length of 20” or 22”. Mine is about 17” long. The special features of the Pekingnese breed are wonderfully done and the staff was very helpful in finalizing the details of his appearance. I kind of regret not paying the $49 surcharge to get my Cuddleclone fast tracked in manufacturing, but it seemed like a lot of money at the time. However, it would have helped with grieving during those weeks after he died to have gotten him sooner. But if you don’t feel you can afford it try not to feel bad - you have your very real memories and love. I ordered my clone sometime around Nov. 25th and received it tonight, January 15th, so within the advertised time of around 8 weeks. Being able to have this sit by my side on the couch and pet him like we did before is soooo nice and helpful. Honestly, it feels like having his sweet soul back with me, alive. Cuddleclones, Inc., thank you so much for this wonderful service and product.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chad,01/09/2021,I bought my Cuddle Clone as a Christmas gift for my significant other. She’s been saying she wanted one for a couple years but never thought I’d get her one. She had no idea what was going to be in the box and when she opened it I thought she was going to cry. She was ecstatic! And we were both shocked as to how realistic he was. It was a spitting image to him when he was younger. (Which is what I requested) Thank you so much! I will recommend them to everyone. There is no way anyone would be disappointed with one of these. I am very hard to please and have extreme attention to detail. Its just great! Thanks again sooooooo much!!!!! P.S. Jedi still thinks the dog in the mirror came to life.

Melanie,01/08/2021,"Razer is absolutely my heart dog, and I've waited several years before opting to purchase a Cuddle Clone. I didn't expect absolute perfection- there are some spots here and there that I'd add, some adjustment to his main feature, the razor mark on his head. But ultimately? This clone is amazing. They got his eyebrow spots perfect, and gave him a similar expression, and I adore it! I sent the included picture to several people without an explanation, and they thought I'd gotten a puppy that was his mini-me. This was an incredible job, and I appreciate everything about it! I've had to reach out to the customer service representatives a couple of times, and they are beyond fantastic.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For 15yrs he was my friend, partner in crime, best friend and my everything. Letting him go was the hardest thing I'd ever had to do. Nov. 26,2020 My husband ordered a clone of him for me and today, Jan. 6, 2021 that clone arrived and I sobbed happy tears. He isn't perfect, you cannot expect them to be perfect but its pretty darn close and I am thrilled with it. Thank you so much for creating it for me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sadie Oh,01/06/2021," (Apologies, as I have previously posted a review before but accidentally gave it the wrong number of stars. I am reposting it with the correct rating.) I had excitedly ordered a Cuddle Clone some time ago. I wasn't expecting the clone to be perfect. When I had opened the box, though, I felt let down. The body was excellent, size was great, and the tail was spot on, but the face was completely wrong! My dog is a mutt, and he looks a bit like a cross between a whippet and a few other breeds. (He has the facial structure, size, and chest of a whippet, but with a bit more muscle). The clone I received looked like a pit bull. Even my family had commented that it didn't look like my dog. The clone had also arrived with a tear on the back. I sent the clone back with a few corrections (corrections include: Adding scruff + the loose skin under his neck, adding paw pads, fixing tail, redoing face and snout, making markings on chest more subtle, having the eyes more closer together and larger, and having neck a lot shorter). I also sent a few additional photos. Customer service was excellent though, and I sent the clone back feeling optimistic. When I received the clone with the corrections, the face was better but my dog still didn't get that \whippet\"" look to him. The snout was still too fat as well. I had asked for larger eyes but I assume they don't have different eye sizes... The clone also still had that long neck",and the scruff and loose skin were not added. I had seen the company add the scruff and loose neck skin on other clones,so I am a bit confused why it wasn't added. The markings on his chest were exactly the same. The paw pads were added,though. Unfortunately,when the head and neck of the clone was redone,on accident,the company used the wrong length of fur. So now the head and neck has longer fur than the body,so the clone looks a bit like a patched carpet now... And for whatever reason,the tail,which was a 100% spot-on part of the clone with its coloring and all,came back with no color. I was aware that I couldn't send the clone back a second time to get any more unnecessary corrections,so I sent the clone back only to get the tail colored again. Like I said,I wasn't expecting the clone to be perfect,but it just didn't turn out well. That being said,though,customer service was still fantastic throughout the whole process. It’s obvious a lot of effort was put into making my clone,though the fact that 80% of my corrections I had asked for weren’t made,and half the fur is one length on the clone while the other half of fur is shorter,left me disappointed. As you can see in the pictures,the clone only loosely represents my dog,you can see that the facial structure is still off after the corrections,and that there is no scruff or loose neck skin on the corrected clone. The overall structure of the body is alright,but I wish it matched the picture I sent a bit more. You can sort of tell it's my dog,but it doesn't look exactly right. Other people seemed to have much better results. (Of the 9 people that have seen the clone,8 have outright said that it didn't look like him very much). Tldr: Clone didn't come out well first time,sent it back for corrections,number of corrections weren't made,"though good customer service!""",

Devon,01/06/2021,"Decided to get a cuddle clone of our senior dog for my wife's birthday. First off, the people in the company are quite quick to respond by email if you have any questions or concerns, usually within 10-24 hours, faster sometimes. The shipping option I chose said it would take 8 weeks for the Cuddle Clone to be made and then delivered. However mine arrived after only 5 weeks, well ahead of schedule. It arrived in an unmarked box as I had selected that option upon placing my order. When I opened it, I was amazed at the quality of the Cuddle Clone and at how much it looked like our dog. I could tell by the look, feel and weight of it that they really put maximum effort into the details and quality and durability of their product. A lot of people will say that a Cuddle Clone is expensive, but the quality of the product proves that you get what you pay for. I showed my mom the cuddle clone and before it arrived she was the most skeptical of the price tag. Once my mom saw it she agreed that it was such a good product that it was well worth the price. Thank you Cuddle Clones for giving me the opportunity to give my wife a one of a kind gift that she will always cherish.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Kayla,01/04/2021,"My 6 year old daughter, unfortunately, lost her dogs, a few years back, when her dad and I went through a very terrible divorce. She asked Santa to bring her dogs back to her, as she still cries for them. I quickly hopped online to find how to make her 1 wish come true. I came accross Cuddle Clones and I couldn't have been happier. My daughter cried happy tears and has not let her dogs out of her site since. She quotes \BEST PRESENT EVER\"". The joy in her eyes to have her dogs back with her in any way has been beautiful to see. Thank you!!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I was thinking for the price I would’ve received a higher quality product so this is quite a let down. It doesn’t resemble her very much but I did not expect a perfect duplicate but I did expect a well-made item. I wouldn’t recommend spending money on one of these.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Matthew,12/29/2020,If you don’t have one you need one ASAP. First off my wife loves the slippers and clone of our Husky. The slippers are comfy and they keep your feet warm. Second our Husky thinks we have another dog. She’s honestly jealous when she sees the clone or the slippers. So hands down this is an amazing product and worth the time it takes to produce. Just beware some dogs might get jealous and you might need to give him/her some extra love.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I decided to give it a shot and I absolutely could not be any more happier than I am right now. So detailed! From the dots on his nose to the color and color pattern, all the way down to his shaggy tail, they absolutely nailed it! Thank you Cuddleclones for making my daughter soooooo happy!

Mary Wyatt,12/26/2020,"Got this for my husband for Christmas because our Izzy is our whole world and I saw other ones on line and was impressed. I wanted to be able to have a forever Izzy. While it is very lifelike and the coloring is perfect and does resemble her somewhat, it isn't as much like her as some of the others I have seen. The head is way too big and too wide. I know it must be hard to do. I just saw others that seemed almost identical. You do really good things though. We did love our face masks with her picture. We got the most compliments on them. Even from her vet. And to know part of the proceeds help other animals is nice.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bobbi,12/24/2020,"We ordered a cuddle clone of our mother's dog, Koby, who recently passed away after 16 years of love and life! We explained (along with pictures) that his most beloved features were his eyebrows, bushy beard, and the white upside down T on his chest and my goodness did they nail it! He is absolutely perfect - better than any of us imagined! The details they picked up on and matched... I still can't stop looking at the comparison. This touched our mother's heart so deeply - we were all in tears! What an amazing job your team did on Koby! We are so very thankful! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Christine Jankowski,12/22/2020,"I have been hinting to my husband that I wanted one the entire year hoping I would get one for Christmas or my birthday which is January 1. He told me that was a ridiculous amount of money to pay for a stuffed animal. A few days ago my beloved Newman started suddenly having seizures yesterday I took him to the vet because they seemed nonstop and he wasn’t aware of anything going on around him except for me. I never thought I would walk into the vets office and walk out without him. My best friend, my travel companion,my entire world was gone and I was destroyed. My children are grown and on their own and Newman was with me 24/7 This morning my Christmas present came and I stared at the box for hours. I didn’t know if my heart could take disappointment if it didn’t look like him. but I am so so happy and finally smiled for the first time in days. It looks so much like him from the half curl of his tail to the slight outward turn of his paw. so much in fact that his little brother who has been missing him, actually started sniffing it like it was a real dog and wanted to play The fact that you made his fur thin in some areas because the real Newman had allergies and this is exactly how his fur looked is amazing. I can’t thank you guys enough. Even the real Newman‘s collar fit him perfectly. Now when I cry as I often do throughout the day I will have a new friend to comfort me who looks so much like the one I’m missing",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The face is scrunched up and not the typical face of an Australian Shepherd or Poodle. We understand that it is on us for not adding the additional pictures,so buyer be warned to add those pictures! Do not assume they know what the breed looks like! They also missed some of her coloring due to it being light brown,"not sure if they just assumed she was \""dirty\"" but that detail was completely missed.

Allana M.,12/06/2020,"It's a pretty close duplicate of my Dexter, but a couple things are a little off. They did his hair darker than it was in the photo I submitted for fur color. I was using photos taken of Dexter throughout his life to get all the angles requested, he has lightened throughout his life, but the photo I submitted for fur color was one of his more recent photos with him being more silver. I also made a note about him being more silver now. the hair on top of his head is very light silver, almost white. The white of his beard is also a bit wider than in real life, real Dexter has a goatee situation. I may try to color the clone's beard on the sides to fix that, but I haven't decided yet. I ordered this in a moment of panic because I thought Dexter was dying and I clearly wasn't emotionally prepared for that. Overall I am pleased with it. It's slightly smaller than Dexter,but his clothes fit it pretty ok. I think it will offer some comfort when Dexter does leave us, which is the reason I ordered it,so it will serve its purpose",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Shauna,12/02/2020,"I will admit that I didn't have the best experience with this company to start. The customer service, false discounts and huge customs fee really took their toll on me when I first ordered after debating about it for 4+ years. I can however that the result of my cuddle clone far surpassed anything I could have hoped for and really made it worth it. I videoed myself opening it and cried a lot of tears of joy with how much it looks like my girl. With only the smallest details missing, I can tell you that the work their did was a amazing and really feels like my girl Phoenix. My Girl is 14 and while she is still doing great, their will be a time where the pain for me will be unbearable and to finally feel like I can have something physical to hold when that pain comes...I cant even describe. I plan to purchase again for my other dogs and hope my experience is a better one and that the outcome is just as good.

They got her bushy eyebrows, the white spot on her nose and the tiny tuft of beige fur on top of her head. Her cat siblings think it's really her and they cuddle it and even groom it! It looks so much like her I still do double-takes when I see it on my bed. I got the pouch option so I could put Asia's ashes in it and it is definitely a worthy resting place for my perfect girl. I will miss her forever but having her Cuddle Clone makes it feel like a part of her is living on in a way with a continued presence in my life.

I decided I needed a Cuddle Clone of him and I was absolutely amazed how much it looked just like him. Thank you for helping this dog Mom memorialize my sweet angel 🙏🐾,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Abby Mulholland,11/17/2020,My beloved Shitzu poodle Chewy went over the rainbow Bridge 9/16/ 20 she died of the doggy flu due to not eating on her last day on earth I woke up she wouldn't stand and was heavily breathing I quickly woke my mom up Chewy has to go to the vet NOW she's heavily breathing😭 my mom reminded me to be strong as she took Chewy to the Vet with my brother. Chewy died in my brothers arms right when they arrived to the Vet so it has been hard I ordered a cuddle clone for me and my family for Christmas and I can't stop happy crying it looks so much like her I love it it makes me feel like she's still with me . Thank you so much!🐕😭😍🌈,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Erica,11/17/2020,"We had to put our sweet Boxer down about a month ago. I ordered a CC for my husband’s Christmas gift. I received it yesterday & when I opened the box I laughed & cried. First I laughed because they got the little details that made him unique, & then I cried because it looked so much like him. My husband will love it, but I better have the tissues ready. Thank you!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jennie Mohler,11/17/2020,I was not sure what to expect when my clone of my most beloved Rhett arrived...and even as I write this a l tears well in my eyes...but it was better than expected and more. I immediate grab my clone of him and gave it the biggest hug and cried. Was so much like him in so many ways. And even his sister did a doubt take. I found the process of finding the pictures to create his likeness cathartic...and honestly having Rhett’s likeness the best memorial.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Marti,11/17/2020,My little guy passed after 14 years by my side. Having him memorialized with a cuddle clone plushie helped ease the grief. So happy with the product and how it captured his essence!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Alesia,11/17/2020,"My husband and I recently received our Cuddle Clone of our beloved Frenchie, Prada. Our Prada went to heaven in May and when I saw your advertisement on FB I had to order one so I could “hold” him again. The replica you made was outstanding and hubby and I both cried when we saw it. You captured his look perfectly, right down to the “Superman” white crest he had on his chest. Thank you so much for offering these sweet cuddle clones, it helps to ease the sadness of losing our precious Prada.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Endra Shorts,11/16/2020,Looks similar to my doggie but not like some others on the website. I like the eyes and the color.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thanks to my husband for ordering it and thanks to Cuddle Clones for doing such a wonderful job!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rebecca M,11/16/2020,"After spending a decent amount of money I would think that major details would not be forgotten.....for instance, my dogs eyebrows!!! As you can see from the pictures posted - one is clearly my dog and the other is \clone\"" that was sent to me. He is in kidney failure and I was really hoping this would be a pleasant reminder of him when he is gone","however I don't see my dog when I look at this very expensive stuffed animal and it breaks my heart 💔""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Amber Reid,11/16/2020,"I stumbled across this site just days after my 2 year old support dog passed away unexpectedly. With my heart still heavy, this plush has helped bring my sweet boy back to me.

Katherine Cadieux-Leblanc,11/15/2020,"They did an incredible job with my clone. I ordered a clone for my brother, our dog died a couple months ago and we terribly miss him. So finding pictures from every angles were hard but they managed to do an amazing job. They even put him on his side like he always did since many of my pictures were of him in that position. I didn’t even ask, it made my heart melt. Truly recommend it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Amber,11/14/2020,Jewel was the best cat I ever had and it broke my heart when she died. I was skeptical about how good this was going to turn out and I have to admit I was impressed. The pictures don't give it justice. Thanks cuddle clones for doing such a great job. There was a slight misunderstanding about shipping but customer service responded immediately and it was resolved and I couldn't be happier.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Kathleen,11/14/2020,"Our Cooper Cuddle Clone was a gift for my grandma’s 100th birthday. The original Cooper lives in Florida and Grandma in Illinois - she loves it when Cooper comes for a visit (now not possible during the pandemic), but also loves her Cuddle Clone!

Stefanie,11/14/2020,"I purchased a cuddle clone for my dtr for Xmas as she will be going away to college soon. The bond she and our dog share is unbreakable. I am blown away by the attention to detail on this stuffed animal, and the striking resemblance to our dog. I know my dtr will be comforted each day with this by her side. Very happy customer!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Andrea Younger,11/14/2020,"The clone itself is amazingly accurate, we're very satisfied with it. Makayla had a fatty tumor on her side & a skin tag on her tail which the artist recreated nicely. It's the little things like that, that meant the world to my son. The timing of its arrival couldn't have been any better, she passed the day after we received it in the mail.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Carly,11/13/2020,I bought my cuddle clone after my sweet dog passed away after 14 years. The team did a great job personalizing and making it look just right. The customer service was excellent and the product quality is excellent. Could not have been happier.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Zeus,11/11/2020,I had received my cuddle clone of my now deceased basenji. The for pattern is spot on but because basenjis are skinnier dogs and have skinny heads his head didn't fully look right. But It was probably due to the fact that I took the pictures for the cuddle corn one day before he died. Overall we still loved it It was nice to have a reminder of the angel we had recently lost.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Kristin Johnson,11/11/2020,We tragically lost our amazing pups this past August and we wanted something to remember them by. Cuddle Clones did an AMAZING job with our babies!!! There was a slight over sight during the original making of them but they made the return/correct process flawless and I had my babies back in no time!!! I would recommend them to EVERYONE!!! Amazing! I love how they turned out! THANK YOU!!!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Jessica Sarkissian,11/11/2020,When I opened the box before I even saw the face I started to cry how much the color and extra tufts of hair from marks she had were shown. It was the great attention to detail in her coloring placement and fur that made it really her. I love it and I place it in her usual spot next to my desk while I work and the other pup and cats approve too.. took them a day or so to stop sniffing it looked so close to her:),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Kelly,11/11/2020," I came home after a long hard day teaching under the stresses and strains of Covid regulations. The house was quiet, no Oliver to greet me with his happy face and wagging tail that always melted my worries and brightened my spirit. How I miss him. A box waited for me on the step. I took it inside, opened it and immediately recognized the hair and shape of the tail of my clone. I felt my breath draw in sharply because even this small part of the clone was my dog! I am sitting here in my room, tears of gratitude pouring down my face as I gaze upon this beautiful recreation of my dog. I cannot express how thankful I am for how you captured him so well. And what a small comfort it is to have this on my bed waiting for me as he used to do. Thank you, sincerely and deeply, Kelly",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nicole,11/10/2020,"We took in a child on the spectrum who had been through too much. Getting her to open up was what our dog did best. Our dog got her to smile and love again. However, every dog goes to heaven. My daughter now a high functioning spectrum teenager watched her best friend disappear in front of her and felt true loss for the first time in her life. We thought Cuddle Clones would be a perfect way to help her hold on to the memories she had with her dog. Her best friend.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jamie,11/10/2020,My family completely surprised me out of nowhere with mine. My dog of 10+ years Peanut wasn't just a dog to me he was my soulmate my son my everything really.

P. Edwards,11/09/2020,"Although they made my clone a little bigger than the size my dog was probably because scale is difficult to determine through photos , I was very impressed with the detail! It’s been very comforting for me!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Daniel,11/04/2020,"On October 4th 2020, my family and I decided it was time to lay our dog, Lady, to rest. We scheduled an appointment with the vet for October 6th. She was 14 years old. We got her when I was 15, I'm now 29. Almost half of my life has been spent with her. She became my best friend, my child, and a sibling to me. I wasn't ready to let go by any means, but I knew it would be the best thing to do for her, as she was in pain. The night of October 4th, I started looking for websites that might make a blanket with her face on it, or something along those lines. I had a few websites in mind, Cuddle Clones being one of them. When I woke up the next morning, I did a little more research, and decided to go through you guys. I read reviews, I saw pictures of what people received, and I was blown away. I saw you guys made Plush Clones, and I immediately knew that's what I wanted. The price didn't matter to me. I just took the pictures, and placed my order. Fast forward to November 2nd 2020, I received my order. I stared at the box for around 10 minutes. Finally, I got the courage to open it. Once I removed the tissue paper and saw the coloring on the fur, I lost it. I started balling my eyes out. Once I composed myself, I took it out of the box, and just hugged it. I can't thank you all enough for the work you did to make it look as close to her as possible. I am absolutely blown away by how close the coloring on the fur is, in relation to how hers was. You all have given me something to look at, and immediately think of her. And it means the world to me. Again, thank you. Thank you to everyone who played a part in creating the clone for my family and I. Thank you for the care, and attention to detail you all put into it. Thank you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Doug,11/04/2020,"I ordered our plus as a memorial to our Bella, who passed this year. The likeness is close but it’s not quite her. I was a bit disappointed in that. The kids love the plus and recognized it as Bella so, that’s what counts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ciera,11/03/2020,I am in love with my Cuddle Clone. My neighbors found Anthony when he was a duckling and raised him after he was abandoned by his mom. Anthony was very sweet and loved to hang out with me. The other neighbors thought he was annoying and they hated him so someone grabbed him and took him away. It broke my heart as I have no idea where he is and what happened to him. Then I came across Cuddle Clones. I sent the pictures of him and waited. I felt so many emotions when I opened the box and saw the plush version. It looks so much like him. I haven’t put it down yet. It’s beautiful and now I feel that I can cope and remember him better,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Misty Busic,11/02/2020,"I ran across a cuddle clones advertisement on Instagram and knew that I had to get my husband a golf club head cover of his girl, Shakes. She was a border collie that we got the year we were married. They had a special bond even though we had 4 other dogs. Shakes passed away when she was almost 15, so it was difficult on the whole family, but especially my husband. When he opened the box not knowing what I had gotten him, the look on his face was priceless. The head cover looks eerily like Shakes. I was so impressed. The quality is excellent. Thank you for capturing his special girl and bringing her back to life with this beautiful product! I highly recommend Cuddle Clones!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tom Caulley,11/01/2020,"The Cuddle Clone of our dearly departed Pumpin' Seed is very lifelike. It makes us feel like her spirit is still with us. The Cuddle Close is so lifelike that it freaked out our new kitty who became very insecure when this \new kitty\"" appeared in our home.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
David,11/01/2020,I ordered a cuddle clone after our almost 13yrs old dog had to go to sleep. I am very impressed on how it turned out! my youngest daughter (4) is always taking him places with her. Quite a few times I thought it was him sitting here!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Kelly,10/31/2020,"I was so happy with my cuddle clones it made me cry when taking it out of the box has it looked just like my cat grace. Even know my cat is still here its a good keepsake for when she does go to Remember her by. So thank you cuddle clones for bringing this option to our lives. Pictures are great but to see a mini version of your pet in the house, to touch, to hug ... it heals our hearts just a little. Thank kelly xxx",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

April,10/30/2020,"I lost both of my babies earlier this year, and wanted to find the perfect way to remember them. I came across Cuddle Clones through Tik Tok, and knew it was the perfect thing for me. I purchased both clones with zipper pouches and love how they aren't easily visible. They did a great job at capturing the essence of my babies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Suzanne Bastian,10/29/2020, I to put my sweet boy Schultz down on October 1st of this year and I am so glad I have him forever in my Cuddle Clone. It is perfect and almost makes me think he is there when I come around the corner and see the clone on the table. The quality is outstanding and the artist did a wonderful job capturing his essence. I would recommend a cuddle clone to anyone,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Elena,10/29/2020,"Love the idea, but didnt go through as well as I had hoped. Seems like they just did the breed and not so much by what the pictures look like. Asked my mother in law what she though(it was their dog) and she said it was ok but not really like buddy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jodi,10/29/2020," Yesterday I received the Cuddle Clone that I ordered of my mother's and my old dog, Summer. (I bought it as a Christmas present for my mom.) We believed her to be half Lhasa-Apso and half Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier. She died in 2018 at age 16. After reading some negative reviews of the products, I was a little nervous about what I might find when I opened the box, but instead, I was stunned! “Summer's” designer(s) and artist(s) did the most amazing job on her! I could tell that they really paid attention to her photos and description. Although smaller than life-sized, the resemblance was so accurate that it was almost eerie. I had requested that she be made in a puppy clip that looked like it was beginning to grow out, and be slightly looking up, as if at a camera. They nailed it! Even the expression on her face was spot on. The dog was completed in five weeks, as opposed to eight, so I received it earlier than I thought I would. In the meantime, I appreciated the e-mail updates. It was well worth the splurge! I'll be sending an updated review after I give it to my mom at Christmas. I know she's going to be so surprised! Thank you, Cuddle Clone team, for giving a little bit of Summer back to us.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Kristi N.,10/29/2020,"We have a mutt. He looks like a golden retriever/collie/Belgian tervereen/saint bernard mix. Try finding anything that looks like that! He's 13 now and is starting to really slow down. It's heartbreaking. We were so excited to find this option for us. It's going to be hard when he passes, but now we have something that looks so much like him. When we see it out of the corner of our eyes, we don't register it as a stuffed animal! I love that we can adjust his ears - that way we can match whatever our boy is doing in real life. His snout isn't quite right, but it's not enough to be upset about. We love it!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Molly,10/28/2020,I am so excited to finally be writing a review about your company cuddle clones . This company fascinates me and always has .

Charline Savoie,10/28/2020,"I ordered my cuddle clone when I knew my baby was getting sicker and I would have to say goodbye to her in the near future. Losing her was the hardest day of my life, it completely broke me and left me shattered. My cuddle clone is the only thing that brought me comfort after her passing. I walked around everywhere my clone for the first month or so. Totally worth the money. Helped so much with my grief, thank you for capturing my baby’s look so perfectly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Louise, Lilly & Gizmo",10/27/2020,"WOW!! Do not hesitate to get your fur babies Cuddle Cloned! We recently lost our little one and ordered his clone straight away. After the initial ordering online I even managed to send a few more over enduring all his special features were noted. After around 7-8 weeks he arrived and nervously got him out of the box and wow! The first thing I saw was his tummy EXACTLY how he was . Lots of tears (and joy) we had our Gizmo back. He's VERY VERY realistic and seriously helped out through the grieving process and is so nice to see him back in his usual places in the corner of my eye. His sister was a little unsure at first bring so realistic but realised and snuggled up with him. I'm now getting my other little one donewhich I have every confidence she'll turn out amazing. Thank-you SO SO much to everyone involved at Cuddle Clones I don't think you realise how much it means to people especially when a little one has gone to have them 'back'. Louise, Lilly and Gizmo",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Kate,10/27/2020,"My mom lost her beloved cat Smokey a couple of months ago. My stepdaughter wanted to do something special to help my mom remember him. We ordered a plush, which was amazingly close to mom’s Smokey, complete with a place to put his ashes. I can’t say how wonderful this experience was for me helping my mother remember Smokey in a sweet way. Here’s the pictures to prove how close this plush really is!!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Corey,10/27/2020,"After losing our dog Leroy after 13 years, our family went from 3 to 2. Getting a cuddleclone of him to hold his ashes seemed a must. Even after being super impressed with the care of accuracy the artists take, and the massive number of happy reviews, we couldn’t have been happier to see our Leroy looking at us once again as soon as we opened the box! - We were crushed to lose him only weeks before moving into our new home (which had many amenities designed specifically with him and his old aged limitations in mind. The fact that he was delivered on our doorstep the day we moved in was just perfect. Thank you to the artists who put so much care into getting the details of our beloved family members, just. right. Already ordered one for my mom for Christmas and he is equally amazing! Cannot wait for the big surprise!☺️",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Madeline,10/27/2020,The two cuddle clones look very much like our cats. The specific markings were done very well and the attention to detail is superb.

Kim,10/26/2020,"Received the remake of my Bandit clone headcover today, and I couldn’t be happier. The original clone Iooked nothing like my dog, neither in shape nor coloring. But Cuddle Clones definitely worked to make things right with much better results. Now Bandit can happily ride around on the course. Five stars for Customer Service. Four stars for the Cuddle Clone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jullia,10/26/2020,This is the second time I have used Cuddle Clones to make a clone of a beloved pet & I am ecstatic. They captured my sweet horse PERFECTLY!! Cuddle Clones never ceases to amaze me.

Riley,10/26/2020,"I lost my cat last month, 9/9/2020 and ordered it same day and recived it on my birthday 10/8/2020 all in all this was a wonderful plush, my only issue is that his ears a bit too long for his body. but with everything I gave them, they did a wonderful job! got everything correct on him, even his darkish brown feet! honestly, I would recommend cuddleclones to any of my friends who either want a clone of them or wanting a memory of them! it honestly comes down to how good your photos are when you are uploading them to the site.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Natalie Veldhuizen,10/24/2020,"Arrived alot quicker than I expected, and we live in Canada. Communicaton with my designer was so prompt. The resemblance is uncanny. It's the same shaggy fur, lighy gray underneath, and darker in top. Exact eye shape, and colour, and even the same way she lays down. Kitty is a little larger than, Gwen; but more of her to love lol. I know my young daughter will be so..pleased with her Christmas gift a stuffed animal if our very elderly kitty, who she can carry arround with her. Much too expensive, but still a very special and unique gift she will keep forever.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Kate,10/23/2020,"We got a cuddle clone of our sweet little kitty Sebastian just for fun. We were amazed how real the plush seemed. It was great to see how Sebby interacted with it. Sometimes we forget it is not a real cat. We would have given 5 stars; however, the coloring was off (grey instead of tan/brown) and the face was slightly asymmetrical. We love our Sebby plush and would definitely get another. I just feel we would put more details in the comments section next time, like the exact coloring of fur.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rachael D,10/22/2020,Our Archie passed away suddenly at home in our arms due to heart failure. We never would of expect this to happen and we miss him everyday. I loved the idea of getting a plush of him. It turned our very well done and we are happy that we could still “see him”. Thanks again for the wonderful creation of our blue eyed boo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Donna Belbeck,10/21/2020,"You catured my cat's face. Fur and fro t paws were perfect. Didn't like how rear legs were finished because the legs were not completely formed. I felt they should have been full legs. Other then thst, wad happy with it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Christina,10/21/2020,"I am completely blown away by the attention to details! For a plush clone, I was amazed by how much it resembled my late dog, Shiloh. Everything I requested in the details- his purple tongue, a scar on his nose, missing tooth, tufts on the paws, etc. were included. The texture of the fur around his neck and ears was spot-on, and the tail looks like his actual tail. Additionally, I received frequent updates throughout the creation process and the plush arrived quickly! Shiloh passed away in September after over 10 years together and I am so happy to now have this plush clone as a way to memorialize him. Thank you so much!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Robert K,10/21/2020,"My wife and I unexpectedly lost our beloved Jett in a medical episode gone wrong... He was my sofa buddy, and to me was the closest of our 3 dogs. Jett's Cuddle Clone has helped me through the loss of my Jett because his replication is very, very close to how he truly appeared. At night, my Cuddle Clone sits right next to me on the sofa just like Jett always did, which has been very calming and reassuring since he passed away.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Diane Craft,10/20/2020,"I couldn't be more happy with my Scooby replica. Scooby and I were inseparable since he was a pup and he lived a full live. I miss him so much and My husband knew how much this dog meant to me. I was in tears when he surprised me with this because since Scooby is a St. Bernard Boxer mix, It is really hard to find a replica of him. But Cuddle Clones captured him better than I could have imagined. Thank you. I love the clone so much!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Linda,10/20/2020,"I lost my fur baby in July and I’m heartbroken. I had seen the ads for Cuddle Clones and decided to make the investment. I’m so glad I did. When I received the box I cried when I opened it. The details were amazing, especially the shaded coloring of the fur. So happy to have my Chanel back on my bed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tobi,10/19/2020,"This was a bday gift for my daughter from her big brother. After duty and price of the item he paid well over $300 for this gift. The decision to buy it was not taken lightly due to cost and the time to recieve it. So maybe our expectations where too high. Ill let others decide. While the color and details were pretty good, the head size is ridiculously big. Its not even proportionate to the size of the body, never mind the fact that the real dog has a very tiny head for her body. My daugher loves the idea and thought from her brother but admits, like the rest of us that its not a likeliness to the real dog as we had hoped.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Shanin,10/16/2020,"We lost our Bichon Frise on September 14,2020 due to cancer I love and miss her so much as does my Yorkie Belle I had her for 11 years. Emma was 7 years old when we got our Yorkie they were always together Belle and I have been lost without her when I opened the box up and pulled her out of the box I cried and Belle started wagging her tail like it was Emma I am extremely happy with my purchase I have it on my bed where Emma would lay and Belle goes in my room and lays next to it like she always did.Thank you so much for the great Clone of my Emma 💕💕",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Liz,10/15/2020,I was a bit hesitant because our dog is a unique mixed breed and wasn’t sure how it was going to turn out. I purchased this as a gift for my husband and he loves it!! Even our other dog looked at it very confused! Definitely worth it for any dog owner!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Erin,10/15/2020,"I recently ordered my first cuddle clone after my beloved Izzy crossed the Rainbow Bridge. She was 15 years and 11 months old. Although we knew time was not on her side because of her age, her health declined rapidly, within 2 days, and the decision was made to end her suffering. I do not have children so Izzy was my child in a way. The grief was overwhelming. I couldn’t eat, sleep, work, etc. I seriously contemplated seeking medical help for the physical symptoms that were becoming debilitating. The emptiness of my house was palpable. I thought if I could just have something tangible to help me, I think I might be okay with time. So I came across a video of an unboxing of a cuddle clone from a young lady that had also recently lost her pet. The relief I saw on her face sold me on this product. I received my cuddle clone of Izzy this week and I cannot tell you how much it has helped me. She’s a perfect match. Even when I hold my cuddle clone, it’s the right proportions, color, etc. It has made all the difference. I’m doing so much better and I really don’t know how I could have managed without it. I have her on my bed so that I can see her every night before I go to sleep. Thank you again Cuddle Clones!!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mary Holliday,10/12/2020,"I ordered a Cuddle Clone of my dog Hammer so I would have a mini once he’s gone ( he’s a 12 year old American Bulldog) and it turned out amazing!!

Heidi Plate,10/09/2020,We cannot get over how much the cuddle clone looks like our dog! We have the golf club cover and everyone on the golf course wants one now!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jasmine,10/08/2020,"We lost our sweet Kailani on 7/29/2020 after a bad reaction to surgery and medication. It was an unexpected illness and the few weeks prior to her passing was one of the toughest and emotional time for us. I came across Cuddles Clones from Facebook. I thought it would be a great gift for my boyfriend who cherished Kailani very much (he doesn't want to admit but she was his favorite amongst the 3 dogs). The Customer Service at Cuddles Clones are amazing. On the 1st shipment, the product did not quite look like our pup and Cuddle Clones gladly took it back and agreed to redo it. The redo was beautiful and resembled Kailani perfectly. One of our dogs couldn't stop staring at the plush, even sniffed it, and wagged her tail a little. It made me sad that she doesn't understand that isn't her sister. But having the plush of Kailani makes us feel that she is with us. It could never replace the real thing but it makes us smile through the sadness when we look at it. What an amazing product and service! This is a great alternative to pet owners who lost their little one. Or you can make a clone before that time comes. I surely will. THANK YOU CUDDLE CLONES for bringing this option to our lives. Pictures are great but to see a mini version of your pet in the house, to touch, to hug ... it heals our hearts just a little. Rest in Love, sweet Kailani.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stephanie Lack,10/07/2020,"My friend Champ was a brindle Shepherd mix. His coat and markings are very unique. I wasn't sure how my cuddle clone was going to turn out because of that. They blew me away. Truly remarkable. They got his ears with his little flyways. Where his fur was a little longer. The markings were a perfect match. His undercoat. I don't know how, but they did it. They brought me my friend back to me! I feel a little calmer and at peace. Thank you!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandra Seddon,10/07/2020,My first clone didn’t look at all like my dog. The company was very good at giving me a choice of redo or refund. I chose a redo. It arrived yesterday and is mush improved replica. Thank you cuddle clones for honoring your deals.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Jean,10/04/2020,"I lost Coco this summer. She took a big piece of my heart with her when she went home. But then I found Cuddle Clones. My replica of Coco is so perfect, I feel like she is still with me! Friends have gasped at first from the likeness. I was so impressed I ordered more. One for each dog I ever owned.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Christen,10/04/2020,"I got Thomas when he was a very little kitten to be a companion to my first cat, Tobey. Thomas was my baby for five years. He loved me unconditionally and would wait in the window for me to get home from work every day. He loved to be carried around and absolutely lived for treat-time. I always wished I lived somewhere with a yard, because he was an excellent hunter. I met an amazing man last year, though, who is allergic to cats. When we decided to move in together, I knew I had to give my babies up for adoption. My parents were able to take Tobey, but I had to give Thomas to strangers. It was supposed to be an open adoption, but the couple who adopted Thomas cut all contact with me two days after taking him. I have reason to believe they sold him. I was so sad that I would never see him again, and, worse, that I will never know what happened to him. However, thanks to Cuddle Clones, I have a version of Thomas back that I can hold and pet. His fur is perfect. It isn't silky like Thomas' was, but it’s still very realistic. He's very light, but he's almost the exact same size as Thomas, which is impressive since they didn’t ask for measurements. The face isn't perfect, understandably, but they captured every little marking and variation of color in his coat. I can't believe what a good job they did! It felt weird paying so much for a stuffed animal, but the product I received is a beautiful, one-of-a-kind, piece of art that I can keep for the rest of my life. Thank you to the amazing craftsmen/women who designed and created Thomas!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Kasfluv,10/03/2020,"Love, love, LOVE this!! Even better than I expected!! So happy to have a clone of my beloved little girl - will do for all of my “kids” - truly, an incredibly well done clone!! I am amazed!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nadhezda brito,10/01/2020,"My sisters dog, loona was tragically put down at a young age so we had minimal references of what she looked like for this gift, and I am absolutely ASTONISHED at the results. Very tear jerking to be able to see her in such great detail again. Absolutely worth every dollar spent.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Alexi,09/29/2020,"I had my first dog Chica for 13 yrs and was my childhood best friend. We basically grew up together when I got her as a puppy when I was a kid (8 yrs old I was and she was 2 months when I met her) We had so much fun together and was a loyal dog that loved me and my family. I was preparing to transfer colleges and move into my college dorm when all of a sudden Chica got very sick and was suffering a respiratory infection. She naturally passed away in my home on Aug. 17th 2020 a few days before me moving into my dorm on the 20th. She lived a great life and I knew this was the farewell she would wanted to give me so I wouldn't worry about her when I left home for the first time. Cuddle Clones was on my mind as I knew I wanted to get a plush of my best friend as I missed Chica's curious smile and her warm and fluffy hugs. Got the Cuddle Clone in just 3 weeks delivered to my college and I was unsure if they got all her details right as I sent pictures and videos as support was nice enough to give me a discount. She turned out amazing and I instantly hugged my cuddle clone and burst into joyful tears right out of the package. They even added the bottom canine teeth sticking out as she just liked resting her bottom canines sticking out from her mouth at times. She is a Lhasa Apso which is kinda hard to do the fur as my dog had like a puppy cut look and not long but I am impressed in what they did. I will always miss her checking up on me when I was busy with work or enjoy giving her snacks or at times she just waits for human food to fall on the floor and gets excited when we stop at drive-thrus because she knows food and treats come out of the window!! (she was so smart!!) Thank you Cuddle Clones, I am proud of the colors, the detail on her face to nose. Thank you to whoever designed her she will always be my best friend who had supported me and loyal to me. Hugs to the Team.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Alysha,09/28/2020,"I was devastated when my beloved cat Tony passed away several weeks ago. I decided to get a Cuddle Clone so I could have something to hug when I was missing him the most. I will admit, I was nervous while I waited. What if they got something wrong? What if his face looked weird? It turned out my fears were for nothing. He arrived and as soon as I opened the box and picked him up, I burst into tears. He was perfect. It felt like my baby had come back home to me. Nothing and no one could ever replace him, but having his Cuddle Clone to hold has been an immense comfort. It helps trigger sensory memories like the sound of his purr and the crunch of his whiskers against my cheek, and it will help me keep those memories fresh for much longer than they would have been otherwise. Thank you for helping me cope with losing the love of my life.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Susanne,09/28/2020,"My dog Nikos died on 07. August 2020. I miss him so much. Today his clone arrived. When I took him out of the box, I had the feeling to have him on my arm again. He feels so real and looks exactly like my Nikos. I am so happy to have him back here as a cuddle clone. He is now lying on his pillow and looking out the window. That has he always loved to do. Dear cuddle clone team, thank you very much ! You have done a great job with my Nikos and made me very, very happy!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jenn,09/27/2020,"we lost our sweet baby boy Kibbles six weeks ago today at the age of 16 and a half. He was our first dog, and he was a mommas boy. When the plush arrived, exactly one month after we lost him, I immediately cried. It looks so much like our sweet boy. I am so please with the quality and workmanship that went into creating such a close replica of Kibbles. We miss him dearly but we are so thankful for this clone, so i can continue to hug our baby boy. Thank you so much!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sherry,09/26/2020," My Annie girl passed away 3 weeks ago at the age of 17. She was the best dog ever, even my cat was mourning... crying all day looking for her. Our hearts shattered into a million pieces the day she passed. I ordered her cuddle clone in hopes it would help to begin to mend our hearts. *** It came out incredible, so life like people thought it was her actual picture. It is similar in size to her as well. That feeling of having my girl back beside me is priceless and exactly what I needed. I paid the extra 19 dollars for 6 week shipping, it arrived in half that time, 22 days to be exact. Thank you cuddle Clone for fitting some of the pieces of my broken heart back into place and giving me peace in my heart.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Alysha,09/25/2020," I was devastated when my beloved cat Tony passed away several weeks ago.

What if he wasn't what I wanted? What if something looked wrong? He arrived and all my fears were put to rest. I opened the box and instantly burst into tears. He's perfect. He looks just like my baby. It felt like he'd come back home to me. Nothing and no one will ever replace him, but having his Cuddle Clone has brought me immense comfort. Holding it helps trigger sensory memories of him—I can hear his purr in my heart when I hold him close. It's helped take away some of the ache of not being able to hold him again and it will help me keep my memories of him fresh for much longer. I cannot recommend Cuddle Clones enough.

L. Warren,09/22/2020,"This year had already been so horrible, and when I lost my dog too I was heartbroken.

When I first took her out of the box I \happy-cried\"" and hugged her",I love how she turned out! My husband and I both love her so much! We were both impressed by how accurate all the little details in the fur patterns came out,and the adorable face really captures her personality.

Jaritza,09/02/2020,"I bought a Cuddle Clone for my friend as a late birthday gift since I've seen it advertised on my FB feed a lot and I thought it would be good to give her a clone of her dog, Ginger, that passed away a few years ago. I provided a bunch of reference pictures that she sent me and the product came slightly earlier than expected, but she loved it! Her mom and her were crying when they saw the Cuddle Clone of Ginger because they thought it looked that similar to the real dog. She feels happy to have her dog's presence with her and has her displayed in her room. I definitely plan on getting a Cuddle Clone of my first/ current dog sometime within the next year since I want to always have him with me even when he passes on, too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Anne,08/31/2020,"I just received the 2 shih-tzu clones I ordered. I was not hoping for much, and hesitantly opened the box expecting something creepy inside. I am floored. These are identical to our dogs, and I didn't provide very good pictures. They are so good I was almost in tears. One of the dogs passed away after I ordered the clones. He belonged to my dad who has Alzheimer's. My dad has struggled with his loss and I think this is going to be a great help in his grieving. Thank you soooooooo much!!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Aiden,08/31/2020,"When my old man passed away in July, I cried for weeks, i still cry over him. He would have been 14 this year, ive never owned a dog for that long before him. He was honestly the best dog I have ever had the privilege to own. Tubsy loved everyone and everything, if you touched him he would be your best friend forever and would crawl up on your side to lay his head on your chest. I will never forget holding him around like a baby, or the way his fur felt, the way when he would come inside from going number 2 he would feel so good that he'd dig at and roll around on the floor. This plush is really nice, I can tell that you guys put a lot of love in this plush. He has the same extra long fur on his toes, the same white on his neck and head and the same dappling in his fur. I love this plush, especially with my old man's collar on. I was expecting to cry, instead, I just had memories. Thank you cuddle clones for giving me my old man back. I'll forever miss you Tubsy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Kathy,08/30/2020,"I received my Ella Boots Cuddle Clone yesterday. I opened the box with great anxiety to find an exact replica my little girl! I immediately broke into tears of joy. When I put her on the floor for her brother and sister to evaluate, her brother sat right next to her and didn't move for the rest of the day, while her sister kept looking over her shoulder to see if she had moved. I have not put her cremains in her pocket yet, but I did put her tufts of hair in and her collar on. I also sent pictures of her to my friend's and family. To a person, each replied, \You've adopted another puppy that is the spitting image of Ella Boots!\"" When I responded that no",she is not another puppy but a Cuddle Clone of my Ella Boots! My little girl had a very distinct personality and Cuddle Clones captured that with the pursed lips that she frequently exhibited when she was less than pleased with something! I had my little girl from 10 weeks old to 2 days before her 13th birthday. Now her likeness will be with us forever! THANK YOU CUDDLE CLONES! Louie,Billie and I are sending you a really big socially distant HUG!!! The picture on the left is Ella Boots,"the picture on the right is her Clone!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jill,08/29/2020,I had my late K9 sweetie Lily made for a memorial for myself. She definitely looks the part. Even her daughter was a little confused. Even though it's not the real thing. It makes it a little easier.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nikki McDevitt,08/29/2020,Definitely worth the money! Looks just like our family dog that past away!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Andrew Gibbs,08/29/2020,"My wife and I would like to thank you for our Darby clone. My wife had him about 10 years before we met and she was so happy with the attention to detail and likeness. Often I’ll see the clone on our couch and for a moment experience the feeling of having him back. Obviously nothing can equally replace losing a life friend, but it does give us a physical representation and wonderful reminder of his presence. One unexpected wrinkle that maybe better to inform other international customers to, is the customs charge once it reaches the border. $61.00 in Canada, bit of a sting, there maybe a notice in your webpage I missed about this charge, just a note for customers to keep in mind. However the clone itself is wonderful and we are very happy to have had an artist recreate our furry family member and will enjoy it for years.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Justin Freeman,08/28/2020,"Ordered the Cuddle Clone plush as a gift for my wife. It was made after the pup we got when we first moved in together. Sadly he's no longer with us, but now we have a little menory of him that my wife can always hug onto. A fantastic job by the Cuddle Clones team!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Donna Gramlow,08/28/2020,You did a wonderful job on my cuddle clone. It gives me great comfort to fill the absence of my little dog who has passed. I love seeing his sweet little face again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Julie,08/28/2020,My purchase was a gift for my daughter and her kids. It just arrived and they are thrilled. It looks just like their bulldog Rhino.

Clem and Liz,08/27/2020,"We ordered this as a gift for our daughter who left for college.

Lisa,08/25/2020,"When my dog and soulmate, Dakota, passed away, my husband gave me the BEST gift: a Cuddle Clone! It was easy to pick out photos and send instructions. And when my Cuddle Clone arrived, I was overjoyed — and frankly, relieved! It looks so much like Dakota! I hug my Cuddle Clone daily, and it brings me so much happiness and comfort. And now that I've adopted a puppy, I have to keep it up high! :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dorene,08/25/2020,I love my cuddle clone. Looks just like my dog. From his tongue out to the inside of his ears. From the wavy hair on his neck to his fluffy tail and coloration throughout. Whoever worked on my dog I thank you. Great job.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Benjamin Juergens,08/25/2020,Our aussie of 9 years passed on July 2 this year of cancer. It was sudden and unexpected. We were destroyed but I found cuddle clones and decided it would be a good idea. We purchased 2 and the lead time was 8 weeks I believe. It got to our door in only 4 weeks. Very happy about that. As far as quality and accuracy we are blown away. Absolutely love it and recommend it. Very well done and we can’t thank you enough.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bernadette,08/25/2020,I am so so happy with the way my cuddle clones came out. I actually cried when I saw them because they look so real. I’m going to have these for years to come. I can’t thank them enough for the detail they put into them. I love them so much.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Maggie Berge,08/25/2020,I got my order I’m so happy I’m ordering more they look so real and look Just like your Baby thank you j,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Lauren,08/25/2020," I had been following Cuddle Clones for a while and knew that when my girl crossed the bridge I would need to make one of her. That terrible day finally came and I agonized over my thousands of photos of her to try and pick the best ones. Probably like a lot of pet parents I was skeptical; would it really look like her? Would they notice all the small details? How good could they really make it? When she finally arrived, I could not be more pleased. Everything was perfect. All her colors, her patterns, even the way her face (which used to be half black) faded into gray and white. My friend came to visit and told me she had to stop herself from saying hi to the Peaches Clone because at first glance it looked real. It helped me heal knowing I could cuddle on the couch with a life size Peachy plush (she was a petite 40 pound girl so the sizing was so accurate!). Believe the hype, Cuddle Clones are absolutely as good as they say. P.s. I also ordered custom face masks with her cute little face and they are adorable. The fit of the mask is great and it even has a nose wire. Five stars for that too!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rebecca Bargy,08/25/2020,"I was very pleased at the way my gift came out, it was for a friend and when i recieved the gift it looked just like her and had all her features. Just by using pictures that i uploaded it came out better than i expected. I was very pleased with the quality and i will definatly purchase another one",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Steve Davies,08/23/2020,"When we knew our poor Murphy's days were counting down, I started looking for ways I could comfort my wife. Her and her Murphy were inseparable. After he passed away, I knew it was time to give this a go. I do feel it was slightly overpriced, but I had to give it a go. Especially as I don't know anyone who has done this before. It's safe to say, my wife was so over the moon! She cuddles him, talks to him, put him on her lap whilst watching tv, even takes him to bed for cuddles too! Although it will never bring Murphy back, it has given my wife a huge amount of comfort, and dare I say it, worth every penny! I want to thank you so much for providing us with such a beautiful keepsake. It will be cherished for many years, thank you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gerard,08/22/2020,"I was so happy to get my cuddle clone. The estimated wait time was 8 weeks so i was very surprised to receive mine in less than four. My brother and I love our puppy, Dobey, so much and I knew he’d love a stuffed animal of him. I was very satisfied with the quality. I could tell someone put a lot of work into it. You can even change the position of the legs and tail. Dobey also has a cherry eye and I was really glad that it was included. When Dobey saw his clone, he got super excited and tried to play with it because he thought it was a real dog. I just can’t wait to surprise my brother on his birthday.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Amy,08/22/2020,I am in love with this and immediately cried when I saw how much it looks like my dog that passed away 2 months ago. It came much faster than expected as well. I am so happy with my purchase and will use in the future if I ever have the need.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Diane Simcox,08/22/2020,I am am truly 100% in love with my Cuddle Clone. What more could you ask for when your favorite friend is a dog named Bentley and now I have a clone of him. I wanted something special for my 25th anniversary and my 64th Birthday. I waited In anticipation For the arrival of my Bentley clone. I am an avid golfer and I can't wait to display him. Thank you so much you made me one happy person,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Brandi,08/22/2020,I received my cuddle clone for my birthday after my therapy dog passed suddenly early this year. While it doesn’t look EXACTLY like my Bub I could definitely tell that’s who it was. He even has belly spots! His sister was checking him out as well. He does startle next when I walk into a room and don’t expect to see a dog though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Brittany,08/22/2020,After losing are dog I had made a cuddle clone and it looks great I even had people think it was real.i love it ! He would also move his ear back and down when you talk to him and it was the perfect touch that made it perfect.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Amanda Price,08/21/2020,This was my daughter's birthday gift. Our baby boy bandit was killed 2 years ago and he was part of our family. I got this for my daughter's birthday and she balled when she seen it. It looks so much like him. I couldn't help but cry too. I'm debating getting another one for myself! I'm also happy they made it lay just like him!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Vickie lyall,08/21/2020,"There's not enough words to describe what you have done for me by giving me a very special gift from your heart to mine. I am 70 years old and I can't stop thanking you for heartfelt gift of a special little guy who had brought so much love and attention to everyone who saw him. I mean every body. He had an aura about him ,I can't explain and even everybody at the clinic he went to loved him so. The way you put the little things on his body was perfect. The little things in life are what's special and loved. You really go all out doing the best in your work to make people like me , who has lost part of thereselves, happiness back. Even though, I know Spike is gone to Rainbow Bridge, what you have given me back, where I can put his ashes inside such a likeness, is heavenly. Thank you so much. At least, I can hold his twin and talk to him like I use to and lay him down again beside me and have a blessed sleep, because of you, now. You are one of GOD'S chosen one to help bring back some happiness to us.with all my love .",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whitney,08/21/2020,"My Cuddle Clone was a tribute to my furever best friend that passed away from cancer on June 26th. And if I am being honest, it was also a form or coping for myself. The clone looks so much like my Roush. They even captured the brown spot on his eye and how the corners of his mouth would turn up like he was smiling, just like he always did. The clone has brought me a peace that I have not had since I lost my boy. I will gladly share this company with all of my fur family friends. I am forever grateful for the company and my Cuddle Clone for giving me a form of my best friend back. Thank you, from the bottom of my heart. <3",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Monica,08/20/2020,"The original Remy (Roo) passed away at the end of June. He was my first rescue dog, joining me shortly after I graduated from college. We were best buds for over 13 years and losing him left a massive hole in my heart. When I ordered the clone, I wasn't really sure to expect. After I received it, it took me a day or two to really warm up to it because it looks SO much like him and it felt strange! Now, I've found that Remy (Roo) Two is actually helping with my grieving process. It's not *perfect* but it's pretty darn close - Cuddle Clones did a great job! I love that I have a version of my best friend around forever.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jennifer,08/20/2020,"After losing my Roxie unexpectedly, I was so broken. I remember one of my patients telling me about cuddle clones. Best purchase ever. I sobbed when I took her out of the box. Thank you cuddle clones. I look forward to having my pug, Nona done too!! Everyone that sees her can't believe how realistic she looks ❤",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Amy Williams,08/20/2020,"I had run across an advertisement for cuddle clones before my beloved Figaro passed away. He had been ill for quite some time and I am disabled and he was my companion dog and I broke my heart knowing I wouldn’t have him for much longer. So I knew I wanted to have this done as a forever reminder of my son who I had rescued, but he rescued me in every way imaginable. He cared and understood my needs better than any human has ever. His star shines bright above our house. Ordering was very easy, it was the waiting in anticipation that killed me and I paid extra for faster service. When he arrived I was disappointed in two things, they had his snout wrong, too long and fake looking. And his hair was extremely long and way too shaggy. But every thing else his color, his body and his TAIL ABSOLUTELY PERFECT! That’s hard one too, he passed less than a month from his 15th birthday. He had a big beautiful tail and it was always quite a feet trying to get the groomers to do it right. So I was tickled pink. But I trimmed him up myself to the way he normally looked and he looks SO REAL it was freaking my husband out. I love SO much that the ears are adjustable so you can place them in just their right position that fits them. After finishing I put his collar on him. I sent in his older photos, but he actually looks more like he did when was young when we first adopted him. It’s just so amazing. I could sit there and look at him all day long he’s just so incredible. My sweet boy Figaro.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Brealyn,08/19/2020,"My cat, New Cat, passed recently, so I ordered 2 cuddle clones, with the pouch for her ashes, for me and my boyfriend. It came out looking really close, the only thing that I wish had looked more like her was the fur color. She was white with gray tabby patches. The cuddle clone did the white with the tabby patches, but where the patches stop, a brown color bleeds off into the white making the tabby part of her fur look more like a shade of brown than gray. Other than that it looks very close to how she looked and my boyfriend and I are very happy with the 2 we got",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jo,08/19/2020,"ABSOLUTELY love this!! Excellent quality!! I will always cherish this gift from my daughter!♥️ (Clone in top pic, original Scruffy in bottom pic)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Kristen Henry,08/19/2020,"I was so impressed with my first order back in 2016 of my Persian that I decided to give Cuddle Clones another shot. Missy passed away in early 2018; she and my mother were extremely close. Figuring it was long overdue to get something special to commemorate her memory, I finally caved and placed my order. I am absolutely thrilled by how well she turned out! The details are stunning and her sweet face is captured perfectly. I highly recommend getting a plush Cuddle Clone of your very own!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AK,08/19/2020,It reminds me of him good days with him. His forelegs are crossed as he used to.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Aria,08/18/2020,"My Piper passed away unexpectedly on July 4. I had always meant to order her clone before such a thing happened. As soon as I was able to look at her photos without crying too much, I put in my order. She arrived in about half the time I expected. I told myself to manage my expectations before I opened the box because I know nobody could make an exact copy, but I was excited to be able to have her “surrogate” with me. My first thought was uncertainty, but after I put her down and stepped back, then looked closer, I was amazed. Her head is a bit big, but the care someone took to detail her face makes up for it (I’m guessing a more life-size head would be harder to detail so finely). Even things I forgot to mention, such as her nose not being solid brown but pinkish in areas, were replicated. Her eyebrows and head stripe are perfect, as is her fur color (my photo of her on the right is not 100% accurate for color). Other little things like her front feet having more white than her back, and her tail curling toward her while lying down (instead of laid straight behind her). She now sits by the urn and paw imprint...and even though I still talked to Piper before I had her clone, it’s a bit easier now😋 Highly recommend if you have lost a fur kid and having their likeness would bring you peace.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CJ,08/18/2020,So adorable and looks so much like my sweet Chelsie.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Brooke,08/17/2020,"I ordered my cuddle clone after losing my childhood cat of sixteen years. It was so hard to be without her, but now that the clone is here I feel like she’s finally come home again. The clone looks amazing and is SO soft! My only nitpicks are the head is a little big and they used more of a brown for her tan, but I can live with that. This girl looks almost just like she did in life. This has brought me so much joy, sadness, and most importantly closer. The pouch you all created for her ashes is amazingly discreet and fits her entire urn perfectly. I couldn’t have asked for more. Thank you!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Lauren H,08/16/2020,"I was truly apprehensive about ordering for myself because I wasn't sure what to expect and I was afraid it would turn out creepy. I am hands down 100% glad I ordered and I intend to order more in the future of my other pets. My Cuddle Clone is of my beloved Yorkie that has been gone for 3 years now, and whom I miss everyday. My heart skipped a beat when I opened the box and saw his sweet face staring back at me...it was so close to his photo that I started to cry. Thanks for giving me my buddy back, it is truly treasured.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Becky Poulos,08/16/2020,"I got my Cuddle Clone a few years ago, but I never reviewed it. I just wanted to say that these past few years without my little guy have been made much easier with a life-sized replica that is just as soft and sweet looking as he was. The detail is incredible. I could tell the photos I sent were studied meticulously, as every single tiny speckle on his fur is copied exactly. Thanks so much!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I actually have video of the unboxing where you can see wennie super excited thinking that Kilo, who passed, was back home. Kilo is BACK in the PLUSH Clone and we ALL can not believe how real the clone looks that I keep thinking i have a smaller version of my Great Dane . I get creeped out sometimes thinking he is actually there! Illusions! Same thing with the girls and of course Kilos Best friend, Wennie. Great Job Cuddle Clones! SOOOOO Pleased!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jenna,08/15/2020,"The day my furbaby died was the hardest day I had ever experienced. Worst thing...because I was not there for him. I ordered a cuddle clone hearing about them but not knowing how great they would be. Great is not the word, more precise, exact, perfect, heartfelt...because when I opened my Cuddle Clones box, you were able to give me back my Mellow. Now he sits in my office as my guard dog to ensure I am doing my work...just as he always did. You did an amazing job and he does look just like him- all his little markings and spots are perfect!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Martha Hight Anderson,08/15/2020,"We got our Cuddle Clone in 2014, for my husband, who had a favorite dog, a Yorkie Mix, who he nicknamed \Pooper\"".

The grief I have been under from losing him was deep. Now, I have his ashes and his paw prints that his vet made for him ,or inside of him. I can pick him up once again and tell him I love him and pet him. I had so much SORROW, and now I have so much Happiness.

Ayuko from Japan,08/14/2020,"My parents had a Jack Russell until last month. They loved him much, so I wanted to do something to make them feel better and at the same time, to always remember the fur covered little boy. When I placed the order, I forgot to add the most memorable feature of him, so I tried to reach out for help and kindly they accepted my request. After a month, the plush was delivered. The size, the shape, the color very much looked like him! Seeing him again made me feel emotional but I’m very happy, and my parents are so impressed. Today, my aunt came to my parents house without knowing the plush would be there, and she didn’t understand for a moment what she was seeing! (Is it a new puppy? But looks so much like him?! What’s going on?!) :)) Thank you Cuddle Clones, I’m happy and I can’t wait to see him tomorrow!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stephanie,08/14/2020,"We purchased a plush cuddle clone of our sweet dog who had passed away. When it arrived it was extremely emotional, as the plush was so realistic.

Rebecca,08/13/2020,"I bought the Cuddle Clone because my kitty died of feline leukemia. Well, we had to put him down. My 10 yr old was heartbroken and cried pretty much every night cuz she missed her Tiggi for months. After receiving her clone, she hasnt cried one night and it's been 2 months! I'm very pleased with the replica, I just wish it was a little softer and the eyes were a bit less creepy looking. I also wish the cat had better toe pads instead of just marker. Other than that, worth the money. You changed my girls life! ♡",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Angela V,08/13/2020,"The colors of my dog were spot on. My chiweenie passed away in March, so I decided to memorialize him by getting a cuddle clone. My only negative is that they forgot to give him whiskers lol and the clones eyes are bigger than his, along with some facial marks missing but all in all, I love it. I had bought a Groupon for it being 199.99 instead of 250 and the Groupon included shipping",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mia W,08/12/2020,"About 2 years ago, I entered my Oreo in a contest for Pet Parade, but sadly my baby passed away earlier this year in February. So once I found out in June that he had won the “cutest cuddle” award, I was more than excited to keep his memory alive. I was so nervous trying to get all of his pictures together, but I couldn’t wait to see the finished product. I instantly cried the moment I opened the package. They captured every bit of him!! Thank you so much!! I have my baby back!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Lisa,08/12/2020,"I lost my dog on June 16, 2020 and it’s been devastating. My friend ordered this for me to help me. The day I received it I was anxious due to other issues and once I opened it I was unsure about it but then I was looking at the little details. Once I put it on my lap my anxiety went away. It has a few parts that I find weird looking but overall I’m happy with it. I have sent several pictures to my family and friends, and they were very impressed with it. Anyways, it is expensive but honestly it’s comforting to have. I have it on a bed near his ashes and paw prints.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Brisky,08/11/2020,I love it! My Friends pup passed away recently so this was the perfect gift. I love how they really put the details into her face and they were awesome when I was speaking with them about everything I wanted. Definitely would recommend. Thank you so much 🙏,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jessica O’Neill,08/10/2020,"I just received my cuddleclone of my deceased, Golden Retriever, Casey. I am in tears with how happy I am to have it! I recommend this company to anyone who is considering on getting a mini fur baby! Words can not describe how much joy this has brought to me 💜 I will buy again in the furture!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sydney CZ,08/10/2020,"I lost my baby a few months ago and it has been so hard on me. I saw this place come up on Facebook and I couldn't stop thinking about it. I had to get one. It was so worth it. I was in complete shock when I opened him. I have to admit I wept when I pulled him out of the box. He is the splitting image of my dog. I knew it was going to be amazing, but I wasn't quite prepared for just how amazing it is. There are details on him that I hadn't even thought about and I am just so happy. I am so thankful for the wonderful people of this company. He's more than everything I hoped for and I feel like I might be able to be a little more at peace with his passing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Kovu,08/09/2020,"Kovu was a wonderful cat. I miss him. I got a cuddle clone of him after I had to put him to sleep due to him having grand mal seizures. It was almost 1 year exactly after having to put my other cat, Bubbles, to sleep. I just want to thank Cuddle Clones for giving me a clone of him so that he and Bubbles can stay with me in a way, forever. I am very grateful that you were able to get the freckles in his eye done. It is difficult to write more, I am still grieving.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jasmine,08/08/2020,"When Luna died 5 weeks ago, my world fell apart. I was looking for any possible way to fill in the void. So I reached out to the lovely people of this company who were very understanding. The results are unbelievable. She came in very quick (considering that I live in Belgium). A huuuuuge thank you to @cuddleclones for doing such an amazing job. The similarities are striking. You've taken into account all her little features. So grateful. 🙏 So I guess she's kinda home again 🖤",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Penny,08/08/2020," *Canadian Customers Please Read until the end* First I have to say that this was so well done that we both cried when it arrived. It has brought the comfort of a sort of surrogate presence to our home after the devastating loss of our 16 and half year old Chihuahua Pomeranian in May after a short illness (and old age). The house was so empty and there was nowhere to express our love and grief or find comfort other than photos and a few other things we got to remember her. This was just that solid thing to be able to hug in times of sorrow and to love when happy memories came. It was worth every penny just for that, but on top of that they did a really great job. I knew they couldn't get her likeness super exactly because you can't do everything in plush, but it's so close that I am so happy. I read every single review and was a little worried that it might not be right, but I think both the combo of including the Cuddle Clones I saw in customer photos that I liked the best for Lily's clone in my references in the order and not ordering during the Christmas rush made this amazing clone happen. Not knocking the company at all! I am a maker myself and I know Christmas time is crazy, and they have to hire on people to make the higher volume of clones. It seems like through the years (from the reviews I read and looking at how many -of the few there are- unhappy ones said 'bought it for a Christmas present') some of the extra artist's they have hired were not exactly honest on their resumes, and that happens. I thought I'd have a better chance ordering in a less busy season so I would get an experienced artist, and I was not disappointed! So take from that what you will. Overall I am extremely pleased and am happy to recommend Cuddle Clones to others especially if they have suffered a loss. Just maybe get a gift card for your loved one so they can order after Christmas themselves? *A special note for Canadian customers such as myself (and Cuddle Clones if you are listening): They ship via DHL. If you are not used to ordering from outside of Canada or have never had anyone send via a freight shipping service (DHL, UPS, FexEx), they will not only make sure customs puts the maximum Duty on your item, but they will add a little extra on the top for themselves. How do I know this? I ordered that little felted dog version of Lily you see in the bottom right of the photo at the same time as this. It was the same price in US as a Cuddle Clone (it is going on the Christmas tree) and that person sent it via USPS. I paid $27 CDN duty for that. I paid $68 CDN in duty for the Cuddle Clone of Lily shipped via DHL. Customs can only charge a certain amount of duty based on what the item is, and for toys/stuffed animals it is 13%. So somehow DHL got double the duty fee just because they can. You can't contest it, they say it is all the customs fee. But it can't be. All 3 of them do it, the only one who is legitimate is USPS as they don't force the duty to be paid, it is left up to customs to decide if they even want to bother charging you. It wouldn't deter me from buying Clone Lily again if I needed a replacement, I am SO happy with it. But it stung a bit and they held her hostage until I paid the duty online because they aren't doing cash on delivery right now. She took an extra 10 days to get here because of that too. It's just an FYI. Cuddle Clones if you're listening maybe switch to USPS to Canada? A lot of us won't shop with people who use freight companies because of this kind of price gouging. I understand it is pretty much the only way to ship to the rest of the world, but we're not the rest of the world, we're just up a bit from you. If it's based on discounts and what is easiest for you, I get it, but it's a thing to think about in the future as many companies who have switched have found an increase in Canadian purchases and probably in purchases from your Island and more remote States as well. :) Overall I am so happy! Get one! As long as you lay out what you want as much as possible you shouldn't be disappointed!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Denise,08/07/2020,"Wasn't sure how I would react when it was delivered because she's been gone for 2 years. I really miss her and feel guilty for having to put her down. But she was in a lot of pain and had tumors. When I opened the box I wasn't sad, I was happy and pleasantly surprised. Thank you!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ailee,08/06/2020,"I got the plush as a gift for my husband, after he joked that we should have a stuffed toy made in Woody’s likeness to take on vacays with ya so we wouldn’t miss him so much. He loved it! Nailed the ears and markings!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Arleen Valdes,08/06/2020,"Thank you cuddle clones ! You definitely outdid yourself ! My son was so happy to receive his cuddle clone. I wish you guys would send a proof before finalizing but, it is a great product with great quality! I definitely will use again. We miss our Mia so much and you made it possible to have a little piece of her.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Myra,08/04/2020,"My directions weren't followed for flecks of grey. The white patch is misplaced. I don't think this plush looks much like my Raven in the face, either. I had higher expectations. The whiskers are really long and weird, too. For the money I spent, I was hoping for better.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Raychel,08/04/2020,"I ordered a cuddle clone plush of my horse that i no longer have, named Spirit. I didnt have the best pictures but with what i provided, they made him perfect! He is much bigger than i expected and they did his markings perfectly. He isnt super soft but that’s ok with me. Thank you so much at cuddle clones! Also when i had a question about my order, the CC team answered me pretty quickly. Btw this is my second cuddle clone. My first one was in 2016 of my cat, Autumn. Im in love with cuddle clones!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ekaterina Kidd,08/03/2020,I got the cuddle clone of a puggle for my boyfriend I can’t do comparisons side to side because she past away a year ago. But he loved the clone the only thing he didn’t like is her nose it’s to short for a puggle if it was a little bit longer and the mouth was a little smaller it be perfect. But besides that it looks absolutely amazing and beautiful definitely glad I got that for him,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Steph,08/03/2020,I literally give her a hug everyday. I miss my little Ms.Brys so much. Even my baby girl Rojo (whom I adopted a little while after Brystina's passing) gives her kisses and baths her.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JD,08/03/2020,We couldn’t be happier with our purchase. Fantastic work. Thank you all!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Catherine,08/02/2020,My Max is back and he is gorgeous! Thank you to all the talented artists at Cuddle Clones. You did a magnificent job!❤️❤️,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gabi,08/02/2020,Received this an an anniversary present from my husband. He let me help create it to my liking. I love how well they captured her facial expression and the unique characteristics that make Daphne who she is.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Kerry,08/01/2020,"My dog was really poorly back in June and we were told to expect the worst. We ordered our cuddle clone to remember him and have him with us forever, luckily he pulled through and is still here to sit side by side his clone. We are so so happy, it’s so like him. Would highly recommend. I’m in the UK and from ordering to delivery was 6 weeks maximum I had a dispatched email on 30th July and it was delivered 1st august.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
G. Bell,08/01/2020," Charger is a 12 year Puggle, who was spending a lot of time with his grandparents due to my travels. With the pandemic, my travels have stopped and his grandma misses him terribly. She is a avid golfer so I had a golf club headcover made of Charger. I just received it and was shocked! It was Charger!! A little creepy but in a very good way! I am so excited to give it to his grandma. She is going to LOVE it!! I am so impressed that I will be having another golf club headcover made of another dog for an upcoming birthday gift. Cuddle Clones - your work is absolutely amazing! I can’t thank you enough for the Charger headcover.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rebecca,07/31/2020,I lost my dude Ari about a month ago to spinal cancer right after they told me he had about 6 months. Then I happened upon this product in an ad on Twitter. Cannot stress how freaking awesome this is!!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dave,07/31/2020,"There are mixed reviews about their plush pet clones but there is certainly a reason they are overwhelmingly great 5 star reviews. The level of details you can select in the options while building are great and if you make the right picks I think you will be very happy with the results. 100% satisfied with my order for a gift for a dear friend. They captured the pets likeness and spirit completely. I thought the coat would be tricky but it looks amazing. Know the pet well and submit good pictures and I think you will be impressed as I am. Shipping was fast. Not enough good things I could say in this review. A big thank you to the cuddle clones team! This one was perfect, you guys nailed it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Same,07/30/2020,"I was so surprised to see all the little wavy fur my baby has executed so well. He’s been missing for a few months now and having this makes me so happy. Worth all the money, will have this for the rest of my life, thank you!!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Layla,07/30/2020," Layla is 12 years old, she's an old girl now. I wanted a memory of her before it's too late, so I found this super Cuddles Clones. I checked all the pet's sosies and I decided to do the same. When I received my plush, I was so excited and happy to see it, just the same way I saw her for the first time in 2008. Continue to live as long as you can my old girl, and you'll still be in my heart and my memory. Thank you so much Cuddle Clones ! 👏🏼",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cindy,07/29/2020,"My little Cody Bear past away a year ago at 16 and it took me a year to purchase my cuddle clone. I read the reviews and was so worried I would hate it like some people. I even waited a day to open the box. When my husband and I opened it together I cried. I cried because it looked so much like my little Cody. Sure a few details were off and I wish I could have been there to tell them his body should be slightly longer and his head should be much smaller. But, I was very impressed with the hair color and leg color, the long hair, big ears and long legs just like he had. I left notes that he had long legs and big ears. Definitely leave those specific notes for them because they absolutely pay attention! I put my cuddle clone in Cody’s bed and my husband and I have already been completely thrown off several times walking into the bedroom. I think it’s a good thing and I find comfort in it. I highly recommend purchasing a cuddle clone!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Crissy,07/29/2020,I lost my sweet Mardhall 8 weeks ago. He was my best friend for 16 years. Thank you Cuddle Clones for the incredible likeness and quality. I feel like he's still in the room with me. And our other dog was so excited when he saw his buddy. We love it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Elaniee,07/29/2020,I purchased two clones for loved ones whos boys passed away and they are in love with them! Top quality! From the feel of the fur to the look. Thanks again team,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Elaniee,07/29/2020,"I thought it was a bit pricey but it was well worth it! The clones were so identical, down to markings and all.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Andrea,07/28/2020,My dearest friend lost her pup on her birthday. I purchased the cuddle clone for her so she would always have him.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Clement,07/28/2020,"I showed my family and my grandma thought I had gotten a new dog that looked like my little MaxBob, every thing looks the same but they forgot to add some black near his mouth and they made some of his nose pinkish, his eyes are a bit further apart than real life but overall I give 5/5 because they answered my and my moms questions, and besides the few missing details he came out perfect, glad that I got one. Max had to be put down, he lived to be 17years and 6 months, so I am glad that I was able to get a replica of him :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ellen,07/28/2020,We got our Stella that we lost made into a clone and my god it’s like she’s still here. Even the other dogs are excited about it! The craftsmanship is amazing and so impressive. They got every last detail. So worth every penny,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Donna,07/27/2020,"I lost my fur baby Charlie at the end of May. We had a special bond and I’m really struggling with the loss. Today I received my Cuddle Clone Charlie and he really warms my heart! It’s not an exact match, but it feels good to look into his face and see the Charlie I so miss look back at me. I love him!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Renee,07/27/2020,"Everything was great...beginning to end!!! The attention to detail is incredible! I even added more pics after I placed my original order and they were super receptive to the additions! I’m beyond satisfied! This is a gift for my daughter that is going away to college...she cried when she saw it! She’s gonna miss her buddy so much, but his “clone” will make it a little easier now! Thank you thank you thank you!!!! So worth every penny!!!!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mikalynn,07/27/2020,"I ordered one of these plushes because I lost my pet a few months ago and thought this was a good way to remember him. The time it took for them to make it and get it here was reasonable, and still fast. For the most part it does look like my pet. The face is a little off, but it would be hard to get it exact. Overall, love my purchase.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Linda,07/27/2020,Wanted to try this so sent in pictures of my dog. Results were excellent! My Facebook friends all though I got a new puppy...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Linda Peck,07/27/2020,I received a cuddle clone for a gift. My Chow -Chow had passed away last fall and my husband knowing how much I missed her ordered from cuddle clone for me. I can’t get over how much she resembles my Sophie. It’s amazing at how much work the artists do to make the clones resemble our pets.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Katherine,07/26/2020,I just received my cuddle clone head cover last and I was amazed how they captured Baileys expression! It's perfect!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chris,07/26/2020,"Awesome job capturing the very little characteristics that make my dog Tiki a special. You got the pink around her mouth from her licking, the little spots on her back and legs, even the little knob on the back of her flat head. You even recreated the brown she had for spots and ears. Even the weird ears she has you guys nailed. Customer service was great when I screwed up and needed to change her position from standing to sitting. I can’t wait to order one of my other dog",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rick Tomljenovic,07/26/2020,From the original order process through delivery it was a great experience. Its s great way to remember our dog Cleo. The attention to detail was awesome. Amazing service. Well worth it!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
jamie margavio,07/26/2020,She looks so much like my Niberia I love it and cried happy tears,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Amanda Vass,07/26/2020,"I have been joking for YEARS that when my dog dies I was getting him stuffed. So when he actually passed pretty unexpectedly I felt like I needed to follow through with this. So cuddle clone it was. The process was easy. Just be sure to have lots of pictures of your pet and all their features. I received my cuddle clone 2-3 weeks early and didn’t see the shipping email so I was completely surprised. Lots of people thought I was weird for doing it and some understood why I was doing it. I am beyond shocked at the accuracy of my cuddle clones hair color. It is an identical match. Of course it’s a stuffed animal so no ones expecting it to be perfect but I am pretty impressed by the accuracy. Walking into a room and in the corner of my eye I absolutely feel like it’s him and he’s here. I didn’t want the zipper down the back but almost regret it now as I could have put his ashes in there. Also, they should have a recording inside as an option as well. I have multiple videos of my dogs I would have loved to add his sounds to. But highly recommend for anyone who has lost their pet. Everyone has that pet that truly is a part of their soul and he was mine. ❤️",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patsy,07/26/2020,"Quality Rated at 5 stars! It looks just like my baby girl only bigger. I don’t recall them asking the weight or size. I wish I would have provided and gotten a smaller, cat size. It is amazing though, my other dogs don’t know what to think.! I miss my Lilly!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Christian,07/25/2020,When my Sandy passed away my daughter was devastated. When I saw an advertisement for Cuddle Clones I knew I had to get one for my daughter. When our Sandy arrived we were all overwhelmed by how much the clone resembles our beloved Sandy! Thank you Cuddle Clones for bringing our Sandy back to life and mending our broken hearts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sara,07/25/2020,"We ordered our first Cuddle Clone in 2013 after our 1st dog passed away, as a way to remember him. Recently our last dog has become very sick, so I wanted to get it ordered in hopes that we would get it before it was his time to cross the rainbow bridge. Thankfully it arrived ahead of schedule and we were able to compare the likeness of him to it. Really spectacular, the work that Cuddle Clones puts into making each plush. We are so thankful for this company. We will always be able to honor and remember our sweet pups until we meet again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Constance R Fleming,07/25/2020,"My sweet Morgan passed away about a year ago. Now, thanks to Cuddle Cones, I have a wonderful remembrance of her right here beside me.

Karla,07/25/2020,I love the material and the photo of my dog. I would buy it again. Now I can bring him where ever I go!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Anna,07/25/2020,"My 11 year old dachshund Toby entered the Rainbow Bridge on May 31, 2020 and I ordered a Cuddle Clone to remember him. My order arrived last week and I couldn’t have been happier!

Jonathan,07/24/2020,"Workmanship is fantastic. The markings are really accurate and quite tastefully done. Was slightly disappointed with a small customer service thing but I guess it is forgiveable, and more importantly, recitifyable. I hope the issue in their process gets addressed because aside from that, this is an excellent service and I'd definitely recommend it to my friends.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Renee Catino,07/23/2020,Amazing resemblance to our fur babies!!!! Was super pleased with them!!!!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

penny,07/22/2020,"my lil girl was 16 and my lil boy was 14.. I lost them both with in 2 months of each other. My daughter told me about an ad for cuddle clones. I am so so so happy I ordered them.

When I got the box I had my husband open it.. when he lifted ogy out of the box and I seen the black tip on his tail.. words can not describe the emotions i had.. they will always be with me,,stronger than ever.. thank you so much,, from all 3 of us,, penny,,nut,,and ogy",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Becky Mullen,07/22/2020,"My best friend recently had to let her loved dog to rest. It has been very hard for her as that was the first dog she had gotten. I came across cuddle clones in a YouTube video of a Fallen K9 who’s partner received a plush clone of the dog from his fellow officers. It melted my heart and I immediately thought of my best friend. I told her husband and my husband and we each put down money for the plush clone. They asked for multiple pictures so they could get the likeness of the dog, and just WOW! When the package came our jaws were on the floor with how identical the dog looked. We wrapped up the plush clone and snuck it into her yard where we surprised her. She opened the box and took out the plush smiled and began to cry. She loves it so much! It is so identical to her dog I can’t even explain! This is a wonderful gift to give to someone who has lost a pet and just in general how they offer so many options for putting your pet on a blanket, jewelry etc. thank you so much cuddle clones for helping me create a special gift!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Adriana,07/22/2020,Really satisfied with the result. It was my husband's adoration and now it's his birthday present. Thank you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tiffany,07/22/2020,"My 15 year old mini schnauzer, Stella Blue, crossed the rainbow bridge on June 16, 2020. I ordered a Cuddle Clone as another way to remember her. She had long eyelashes and a spot on the tip of her nose with no pigment. They did such a great job of capturing little details that were unique to Stella.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Taru,07/21/2020,"I had already two other of these plush clones about my earlier cats, so now I wanted to have one for my newest cat too, Valhalla. I got Valhalla's clone sooner than I thought. I don't live in USA, so postages and tariff little startled me, but anyway I knew I will get good product and I didn't get disappointed. Both of my nowaday's cats were unpacking with me this and Valhalla was very interested when saw there is her clone. She gave kiss to clones and purred. I think clone is very well done like those others I have ordered earlier and it got me happy about it and also the fact my purchase gave meals to shelter pets.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My three year old has been very sad and asking for her recently deceased best friend to come back home. Our clone was spot on and looks exactly like our dog. My daughter is more at ease now and loves having a clone of her dog to sleep with. I have highly recommended your company to many friends and coworkers!!

Bobby,07/17/2020," We purchased the plush clone after we unexpectedly lost our sweet girl. Her color and appearance is very hard to capture, but the folks at Cuddle Clones did a wonderful job and captured her spirit. My wife shed tears of joy when I opened the box. The grieving process has been very hard but just having something this close to her likeness has made it feel like she’s still with us. I’m extremely appreciative of this.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mom A,07/16/2020,I ordered a cuddle clone of our rescue dog for my child to take to college. I knew they would be feeling lonely being away from their constant companion. I was so worried it would not be a good likeness but when it arrived we were all so excited to see how wonderful it turned out. I am totally thrilled and want to thank the company for doing a great job with all those pictures. They got the extra body marks and crooked tail right as well. Thank you!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tammie K,07/16/2020,We received our cuddle clone this morning and it’s amazing it feels like our baby boy Sparky is back at home with us. It’s perfect and I love it. Thank you so much for this beautiful tribute to our baby.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Odine,07/15/2020,"Years back I was always thinking of ways to memorialize my Nini. She was my middle \child\"" in between her human siblings. She was my best friend and I feared losing her all the time. When she passed over we had been together for 20 years. Although I have other cats",Nini was my soul mate. She never left me when I moved from place to place. I knew about Cuddle Clones awhile back and knew it was pricey. But this year,I wanted to see her in 3D not just pictures. Every stitch is worth it. When I received my package,I was so nervous. But when I did,I just cried. She looks just like her. I was afraid her beautiful markings would be off,but they aren't.

Jodi,07/14/2020,"Wow! They did such a great job on our little cocker spaniel! They even noticed that the fur on his back was smooth, and the fur on his legs was curly! I hadn't mentioned that in the description when I ordered! The only thing they couldn't capture is the love in his eyes (impossible to do!). Everything else about our clone was spot on!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Amanda McBride,07/13/2020,I am absolutely in tears at how much my cuddle clone looks like my baby did. I can't believe it. I am so so happy! One of the best decisions I've made. Having him makes my loss a little better.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Kelly,07/13/2020,My cuddle clone arrived and my real dog barked at it. She thought it was real. You did an excellent job of cloning her. It looks very real.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Lizzie Johnston,07/11/2020,"After my 16 year old dog Pu passed away my family and I were very distraught. When I saw this website I thought it was great, until I saw the price. After a while of thinking about it we finally decided to buy one. Let me just say that this is the best purchase I have ever made, they details on it were amazing and it looks just like her. I thought it would make me more sad to see it but it actually brought back so many happy memories. I recommend buying this especially if you have lost a pet because it will make you feel so much better. Along with it you can get a zipper underneath them like I did, there you can store important things like they’re collar and anything else you want. I highly recommend to buy a CuddleClone of your animal because of how high quality they are, and everything in between. Thank you so much CuddleClone, I love it!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Maggie Buza,07/10/2020,"I had to put my baby Snickers down last year after months of battling stomach issues. Snickers had Pica, a condition that caused him to eat non-food items. He was only 9 when I said goodbye and was my snuggle emotional support animal. I got a cuddle clone after months of reading reviews. 1000% worth every penny!! Looks exactly like him, including fur in ears and tail! I am SO grateful!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jennifer,07/09/2020,Looks just like my boy Bo. Loved how you got his ears and his color coat the exact same. This was a very sentimental purchase for myself being he passed a year ago.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Amber Kidwell,07/08/2020,"Wow, this clone looked EXACTLY like our Fierce. Everything was exceptional. We have had soooo many comments on how perfect this clone was made. He looks so real. We talk to and pet him like he is real. I do not have a single complaint. Thank you oh so much, it was worth the money and the time it took to make & ship. ♥️ The name on his tag was a sweet extra surprise. I definitely give this company 5 stars and recommend them!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jaimee M.,07/08/2020,"Honestly at first glance I was extremely disappointed. I think my standards were high in the sense of expecting it to look more real, I mean it does look real don't get me wrong, but I think my expectations were too high for the fact it is a stuffed animal; it's not going to be 100% identical. It almost looked creepy to me; I felt a little embarrassed by it so I put him in the other room so I could look again with fresh eyes. I lost Ozzie in October due to renal failure and his birthday is July 14 so I wanted to do one last thing for him. I decided to make some modifications of my own on his face and smoothed the fur out, kind of molded his head a little bit (took a little work), then I finally got it to where I feel it truly resembles him. There was white fur next to the inner part of his ears which made no sense to me so I trimmed it and I think it looks better now. He had white whiskers in his ears so I'm thinking maybe that's why that was there and should have been pushed over but now it's too late to go back lol. I bought some fake white fur to kind of mimic how his ears looked and I think it actually looks better how I did it. The markings overall are spot on. There's one spot that I question why they did what they did. He had one small black spot the size of a pea on his leg but they put about an inch black line in that spot instead? I bought some white fabric paint, hoping I can just make some minor touches (which I'll test on a scrap first). Also on the back foot it looks like some of the airbrush smeared and it wasn't touched up, the paws kind of look sloppily done but I think some fabric paint can help clean that up too. Nothing too major to where it ruins it for me, I'm overall satisfied and I'd like to eventually get one of my lionhead bunny Buster. I'd give it a 4.5 because of having to make touch ups but I can tell a lot of work and thought went into it. (: Included are photos of the touch up I did, photos of Ozzie and how the original looked prior to touch ups and some fluffing (I'm sure you can determine which is which, lol).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sarah M.,07/04/2020," When our 18 year old lab mix Shadow passed away in May, I was devastated beyond words. I'd been thinking for a while of ordering a cuddle clone to honor him, but had always been swayed by the price tag. I decided to go for it shortly after his passing, but admit I was nervous. What if it didn't really look like him? What if it looked *too* much like him and me sadder?! Well, his clone arrived a couple days ago and I was absolutely blown away. He's much bigger and more solid than I expected, but it's the attention to detail that is just unreal. The artist noticed features in his pictures that I hadn't thought to describe. They even sculpted the little old man jowls under his neck! I don't know how they did it, but they somehow captured him, right down to his expression. It was worth every penny to me. As for making me more sad, it really didn't. I sorta cried (a lot) when I first took him out of the box, but it was more cathartic than anything else. It's probably silly, but I catch myself petting him, and it's been genuinely comforting. Though I do sometimes catch it out of the corner of my eye, and literally gasp and jump like 3 feet in the air, I guess that emphasizes how much of a resemblance there is lol Thank you so much to the artists and to everyone who answered my questions along the way. I'm so incredibly grateful!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I AM SO HAPPY THANK YOU SO MUCH,06/28/2020,"I am so unbelievably happy with our cuddle clone. We had to put our six year old dog down and I could not express how I felt seeing her clone. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU. You got every detail right. The speckles on her chest, her missing ear, the scar on her back. So perfect. I am so in love.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Michelle,06/26/2020,"Our Jenna passed away in December. Although we were both heartbroken, my husband was absolutely devastated. She was such a daddy's girl. So I decided that a Jenna Cuddle Clone would be a perfect gift for my husband for Father's day. I am so glad I made that decision. I couldn't be happier with it and he loves it. He had no idea that I had ordered it. When he came home and saw it, he was floored. He even cried. I sent the picture of her to a friend and she thought we actually got another dog that looks like Jenna. This is worth every penny I spent on it. I'm in awe of how much it looks like her. I look into the eyes and I expect them to move. They are exactly like hers, the color is spot on. Her fur is EXACTLY the same color as Jenna's. She just looks like Jenna PERIOD! It still shocks us when we walked past her because for a moment we think it actually is Jenna. I'm just so amazed by this. Thank you for making our memorial of Jenna perfect!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nancy J,06/26/2020,"I lost Daffodil 7 weeks ago and I am beside myself, she was the kindest being out of any being I have known. When I saw that I could get a replica of her I was in. She arrived this week and I am thrilled. I sent pics of her to friends and they thought I got a new Yorkie. She looks so real that I totally feel as though she is here with me. Since I got her I have begun to heal on a faster pace then I thought I could. Friends that come over and see her are taken aback thinking it's the real Daffodil. I can still dress her up as I did the real Daff. I have already purchased another clone of my Pomeranian Lilly who is going to be 7 in July. These creations are definitely a piece of art, I am so impressed. I am also impressed by the excellent customer service. They keep you informed along the way. I am so happy with my new little Daffodil. the real Daff is in the white dress.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dori,06/26/2020,"Worth every single dollar. I was so nervous when i bought the plushie of my doggy odin after he passed away. his passing absolutely crushed me since i’ve had him growing up. he was my first “pet” in the sense that he was my responsibility, whenever he chewed something up, i cleaned it up. whenever he got out i chased him down and brought him home. I got him when i was ten and had seven, almost to the dot, amazing years with him and i still love him more then words can describe. he could make everyone’s day better just by wagging his tail and smiling at them with his sweet little face. i was so worried that a stuffed animal wouldn’t be able to capture the absolute joy and happiness that followed odin everywhere he went, but when i opened up the package i smiled nonstop for the rest of the day. they got it perfect. it is worth every penny and every day i waited.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hailey,06/25/2020,"My dog prince passed away last year, he was my bestfriend for 14 years, without him I was very sad, but when I find cuddle clone I was very happy that I could buy a clone to remind me of my dog prince, when I got my cuddle clone I was very happy with how it looked and it reminded me so much of prince, thank you for putting in so much effort and care❤️",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Joyce Pearson,06/23/2020,I was so pleased with the clone of my beloved Nick who was part of my family for sixteen years. He's laying on my bed now and anyone who walks by does a double-take. I think the artist did an amazing job.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jen,06/23/2020,Tyler’s Cuddle Clone came out so well. I love that his tail can be moved in both positions (up and down). The features are exactly right. Thank you so much for this awesome gift. Totally worth the price.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Margo M,06/23/2020," Nero was my family’s most loyal and amazing four-pawed best friend who lived long 19-year old life. Our family moved to USA 5 years ago from Poland and due to health and age Nero had to stay out there with our closest family. In 2018 me and my sister went to Poland for a vacation and spent exactly one month with our baby boy. Sadly and unexpectedly, Nero passed away in middle of last May and it made us terribly upset. My parents haven’t seen him since we moved out and they took it really bad. With their wedding anniversary and birthdays coming, me and my sister wanted to get something in memory of Nero for them and then I found the Cuddle Clones. This was the best idea- a plushie clone looking exactly like Nero, a great one to cuddle and pet just like our Nero! So what it’s $250!? Would never regret a single penny I put toward memory of him. So, here we are, one month later, with the clone. I was at work when we got it so I asked my sister to open it, send me the pictures and hide it very well. We both cried. My sister said “I thought they send us his body” because it looks so realistic! We woke our mom and got dad to their room. We gave them the box. They read the message on it, and opened it. Instant smile and happy tears on both of their faces reassured me there could be no other gift better than this. I RECOMMEND GETTING A CUDDLE CLONE HERE IN 300% ! YOU GUYS DID SUCH AN AMAZING JOB THAT I AN WRITING AND CRYING BECAUSE I AM SO HAPPY AND PROUD. Thank you! Margo, Nero and Family",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Holly Kemp,06/22/2020,I ordered a cuddle clone for my mom and it looks exactly like her cat Mischif who crossed the rainbow bridge. The Cuddle Cuddle arrived a day before my mom's birthday so I gave it to her on her birthday and as soon as she opened the box she had tears of joy when she saw a clone of Mischif. My mom absolutely adores Mischif's clone. Thank you Cuddle Clones you did an amazing job!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Linda,06/19/2020,"I have ordered a few Cuddle Clones over the years, in honor of past and present pets of mine, and pets of my daughter and granddaughter, and I adore them all! I just got my most recent clone, Red, and he looks so much like my Red, a rescue dog that I recently adopted. I like how Cuddle Clones tries to get every detail of my dog. Red is a 7 year old Chiweenie mix. His little clone buddy is so adorable. I especially love his ears! Red the clone sits happily alongside my other clones, and they always remind me of all my fur babies. My granddaughter keeps her two Cuddle Clones of her dogs on her bed so that she can be close to them every night. I like the skilled art that goes into these clones. I also like that Cuddle Clones donates some of the proceeds to dog rescue. I like that it is a small, personable company.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Elena,06/18/2020, My cat passed away in May 2020. She was my best friend for 20 years and I was very sad about her death. I‘m so glad that I found this website.

Michelle Guy,06/17/2020,My children purchased this as a birthday surprise for me. I lost my furry son about a year ago. When they gave me this amazing stuffed version of my Chewy my heart filled with joy. It was like I got part of him back. They also ordered it with a pouch so I can place some of his ashes in it. It is amazing how when I look at it’s eyes it is like looking into Chewy’s eyes again. Amazing craftsmanship and well worth every penny.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

April T,06/14/2020,"I had my cuddle clone made 2 months before my beloved childhood dog passed away, it certainly looks just like her (to the point it's unsettling to some of my other family members lol) and I find it comforting to have. I put it on the dresser and put my deceased dog's collar on it and when I look at it I feel glad that she won't forget what she looked like. Even in 40 years I'll remember exactly because i will have this to look at and hold.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mercedes,06/14/2020,My beloved pit bull Pippen passed away from cancer a little over a year ago and I grieved so bad and still didn't get over it and today for my birthday my family gifted me a cuddle clone! I have been wanting one since he passed and I cannot even get over how much my cuddle clone looks like him. Every spot and the colors were exact. I cried and cried and hugged him and cannot even tell you how much your company helps those grieve the loss of their furry family members that are gone! I want to thank this company for creating these! You have no idea how you are impacting pet owners! Thank you thank you thank you!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Woody's Girl,06/13/2020,"I want to say thank you to the Cuddle Clones staff for my plush replica of my Woody! If there was ever a horse and rider pair who were truly made for each other, then it was Woody and I! I loved that horse so, so much, and I miss him so much after losing him during lockdown. We weren't allowed at the barn, so I wasn't there to say goodbye, so losing him was extremely difficult. The clone looks so much like him, minus a few minute details. I wasn't expecting 100% perfection, but you guys really hit the nail on the head for his markings. You managed to capture his sweet expression, which I really appreciate! He was well known around the barn for having a sweet face.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jennifer,06/10/2020,"I was so nervous about getting this in the mail. Unfortunately, there are a lot of negative reviews about how the Yorkshire Terrier breeds come out, and I KNOW they are definitely a hard breed to replicate. Way harder than most. But I'm happy to say I came home from work and am pleasantly surprised how my Cuddle Clone is kinda close. Better than I anticipated. Looks similar to my sweet Lola. Thx so much to the artist who did this for me. Can you please let him/her know I'm thankful? Thx so much.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jane Reynolds,06/09/2020,"Our Jackie-O passed away April 30, after 16 & 1/2 glorious years. We were devastated. Looking for memorials, we came across this company.

It was like hugging her all over again.💕",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Morgan,06/09/2020,"We were completely mind-blown at how much this cuddle clone looked like our Sammie. She passed away recently, and having a replica of her makes it feel like she is still here with us. My mother cried when she saw it, she loved it so much. They got every detail to match perfectly, down to every single marking on her body. And the customer service is excellent! They emailed me regularly to keep me up to date with the process. I would highly recommend. It is well worth the cost.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Alyssa,06/08/2020,I like my clone! I got this because my dog passed away and I was hoping it would look a little more like my dog but it doesn’t look terrible. It’s still cute. It got here faster than expected. I even put some of her old clothes and collar on her!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Diana,06/05/2020,"I was so excited to receive Julie's Cuddle Clone, I put this picture on Facebook with no explanation and multiple people thought I had gotten another dog. The commitment to detail is phenomenal. All of my directives were followed. I am very satisfied.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stacey,06/05/2020,"I lost my pup of 13 years suddenly and was heartbroken. Our other dog refused to eat and was losing weight. We ordered a cuddle clone and we ended up adopting a pet that looked LIKE our pups clone. ABSOLUTELY REMARKABLE how much they look alike. When I unwrapped her, I cried, it looks so much like her. Our other dog would not stop barking at it, nudging and licking the clone. Even the DOGS were fooled. Really big and so beautiful. DETAIL is stunning, right down to her tail and markings. She is even smiling. Thank you, CC for making a living monument to my baby-absolutely worth every penny.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jessica,06/04/2020,I have to admit. I was a little nervous as to what to expect but I’m blown away! My best friend lost her fur baby and when I seen this advertisement I had to give it a try. Nothing can bring back the real TJ but let me tell you it’s like literally looking at the real thing! Everything was perfect down to the color of his hair! The detail is mind blowing!

Olivia,05/25/2020,"My sister and I used to live together and we co-parented our Chihuahua-Poodle mix, Bruno. She moved out of state and we decided that Bruno is best to stay with her. Since I missed Bruno so much, I ordered a Cuddle Clone plush to make up for his absence. I received my Clone in January and after nearly 6 months, Bruno and the Clone have finally met! I'm pretty happy with how the Clone was made, very good attention to detail. The Clone is not 100% lookalike, but that's fine. I think it's quite impossible to completely copy my unique dog. I sent it back initially because his color was not dark enough, but Cuddle Clone was so easy to speak with and they made the changes. I also moved between sending the original back for revisions, and Cuddle Clone was able to ship to my new address! Amazing customer service. Thanks Cuddle Clone!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Lisa,05/22/2020,My Biscuit had passed away and a friend gifted me a cuddle clone of him .

My exact words, \I would NEVER pay that much for a stuffed animal.\"" On April 17 I had to have my best friend put down due to lymphoma. It has been hard. She was only 4. She was an extension of me",a part of me,my ride or die. I can not tell you how quickly I looked up the site to order. And let me tell you...I could not be happier with the way she turned out.

,05/15/2020,"When I opened the package I teared up! Exceeded my expectations completely. I’m weirdly attached to my cat and although this is morbid, when I saw an add for cuddle clones and read the reviews I knew I’d never regret this purchase when she eventually passes away. When I lost my childhood cat, the worst part was just her vague absence. I was really touched reading a review from another pet owner who ordered a clone after she lost her dog and noted that while the cuddle clone wasnt ever going to be the real thing, having it in her dog’s normal spots, visible out of the corner of her eye , was immensely comforting. Also my cat loves her clone! She started head butting and snuggling it right out of the box. Thank you !!!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ashley,05/14/2020,"Luna and I, together again, just in a different way ❤ I lost my Luna at age 7 very unexpectedly due to a veterinarian's misdiagnosis on a medical condition. I took her in for what I thought would be an easy visit, then everything changed at the speed of light. I ordered my Cuddle Clone to have a little remembrance of her to sleep with at night. I really missed having Luna laying up against me. I have been cuddling my Luna Cuddle Clone every single night since it arrived. Lots of tears when I first opened it, but it is a much loved reminder of my sweet, sweet Luna every time I see it on my bed. I even do double-takes sometimes. At first, one of my other dogs wasn't sure about it and barked at it a little, but she has left it alone and just sniffs it suspiciously now. The other dog and the cat are completely oblivious to it. 😂 #cuddleclone #rainbowbridge #Lunagirl",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lynn,05/07/2020," Cuddleclones did good job to match my dog's fur color & special required features on the body but NOT the face & ears .My Chihuahua is with apple head suppose to have short snout but they made different shape with long snout and ears are way bigger. They should pay more attention about the details on dog breed's face and pictures when they make a clone. I know it's unable to make 100% match but at least when you look at the clone you can tell \here is my dog !\"" but I don't get that luck like people who got their clones looked a lot like their pet . Just sad & disappointed !! Luckily my dog has not passed away yet","or else my heart would be broken again to see this \"" broken\"" clone. No more thinking of ordering more clone of my dog from Cuddle Clones.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DOUGLAS,05/06/2020,"My 2 beloved dogs had to be put down this year, 3 months apart. They did not come home as they were left with the vet to be cremated. I felt the next next best thing was to memorialize them in this way and now they sit side by side as they did in life. Thank you for the good work and amazing attention to detail.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Allison,05/05/2020," I wrote another review, but after looking again at the photo galleries of other similar cats whose clones matched much better than mine, I have revised my opinion. The quality of the plush seems nice, but the face is quite off. The ears are way too big and the face is squashed vertically. The colors are more muted and muddier than I would have liked -- blacks look more like gray, and the stripes are not very visible. The facial markings are good, though -- care was taken there. It's a nice plush, and certainly reminiscent of my Charlie, but not really a clone. I am a bit disappointed after seeing some more examples of spot-on matches.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Allison,05/05/2020," I lost my Charlie suddenly two months ago, and wanted a way to remember her. I was hoping for an exact match, but I understand that a plush is a tricky medium. The ear and face proportions are quite off -- the face is too short and the ears are too big. But the coloration is very, very close (if only the black parts were a little darker!). Care was clearly taken with the facial markings. The fur length and overall colors are nearly spot on. The plush itself seems very well made, and looks like a real cat. I find myself thinking she's still here when I see it out of the corner of my eye.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Katie,05/04/2020,"Ordered a clone of my Sasha we lost back in November for my mom for mother's day and she just arrived today. Looks just like her, even the wrinkly ear from having a hemotoma drained.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Brittany,05/02/2020,"I bought a cuddle clone for my mother after the family dog passed away, and we could not be happier with how our cuddle clone turned out. My mom is completely smitten, and I can see how much happiness and comfort this stuffed animal has brought her. I recommend this 100%.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Julie Schechter,04/23/2020,"One of the happiest day of our ‘pandemic pause’ was when our Bingo cuddle clone arrived. We’d won a certificate at a dog rescue fundraiser last fall, but hadn’t used it. Finding myself with time on my hands due to the stay at home order, I decided to fill out the application as a surprise for my husband. Alas, as I started the process, I found that the Certificate had recently expired! Fortunately when I reached out to the friendly customer service folks at cuddle clones were able to extend the expiration date for me, and I started the process. Being anxious to see the final result, I checked on my order a couple of times and quickly received updates on the status. The last update was they were checking it at the home office to make every sure everything was perfect. And it was. I would highly recommend this service to any pet lover. The cuddle clone is amazingly lifelike. The attention to detail is incredible. Thank you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Morgan,04/21/2020,"I’m floored. My nerves have been through the roof the minute I ordered. After I opened the box it took me several minutes to even get my cuddle clone of Roe out of the box. Buddy Roe was my best friend for 13 years and his passing hit me harder than any death, animal or human, ever has. I held his paw in his last moments. Now I never have to let go again. I don’t know how y’all do it but you captured him perfectly. Thank you so much.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Kendall,04/17/2020," Adopting Unk-our dog owner experience wasn't typical. Unk wasn't a love me love me man's best friend. Unk was a moody grandpa dog; if he could speak he'd say 'get off my lawn'. He loved to nuzzle occasionally, but spent most of the day tongue out sleeping. At our first vet visit, we were told Unk was anywhere between 6-12yrs old, and had been horribly neglected. Unk would dip in and out of health; one day he'd be on his death bed, getting IV fluids, then he'd be running down the hallway when he bounced back.We knew our time with Unk was going to be short. When I first discovered CC-I knew that I was going to need one. I entered multiple contests, and told myself I know Unk will go one day, and I'll buy a CC-but while he's alive him and I will try our darnest to win one. If we didn't win, I told myself it was because he's going to stay around longer. When we entered the contest, and discovered we were a Top Dawg contender, it was during a downfall I knew wasn't going to bounce back. Unk was the tiniest he had ever been, and he had stopped eating weeks earlier. We tried to take him out campaigning to dog parks, his dog restaurant, and to friends, but he was too weak. When asking friends to vote, I didn't just ask, 'hey like my dog', I told them the story of Unk's ups and downs, they knew how obsessed we were, they knew Unk went EVERYWHERE we went, and I told them this is his last big moment. We pulled out the win. We ordered the CC quickly, because we hoped to get the photos of Unk and his clone side by side, explaining that now Unk knows Mom won't be alone. But there was a sad sort of magic moment. While my husband and I were away on travel, a trip in which we couldn't bring Unk, we discovered Unk had passed. In hearing the story of his passing, we discovered his passing came the same day in which we received the email 'Your Cuddle Clone exists and will now be shipping!\. I like to think Unk knew",that he held on until he was sure I would have someone to hold onto when he was gone,"and once his CC existed in the world he was able to find peace. Thank you for your amazing technology to make it look so realistic.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sarah,04/15/2020,I was nervous as this was a gift for my parents who lost their dog recently and who have been having a hard time with the loss especially during a pandemic. When I opened this I was shocked and even my dogs thought it was real. He’s perfect. Thank you so much I am SO grateful and excited to give them this gift,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rebecca,04/14/2020,"I wanted to give my Niece a special Christmas present this year. Decided to get her a blanket with her dog on it. When it came at first I thought, oh, kind of blurry. But then laid it out and backed up and suddenly it was a picture perfect! Think billboard, too close you can't see it. Step away and it is fantastic! My Niece's dog is very dark so I was not sure how well it would work and the picture was small. It is amazing to look at it and see that happy smiling face looking at me! I am sure my Niece is going to love it! Now if they will only figure out how to do two dogs together on a blanket. I'd order it in a heart beat!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
